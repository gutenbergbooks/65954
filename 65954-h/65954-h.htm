characters were involved. The stories, though based upon

<p>“It should not be expected that an Indian who has
lived as a barbarian all his life will become an angel
the moment he comes on a reservation and promises
to behave himself, or that he has that strict sense of
honor which a person should have who has had the
advantage of civilization all his life, and the benefit of a
moral training and character which has been transmitted
to him through a long line of ancestors. It requires
constant watching and knowledge of their character to
keep them from going wrong. They are children in
ignorance, not in innocence. I do not wish to be
understood as in the least palliating their crimes, but
I wish to say a word to stem the torrent of invective
and abuse which has almost universally been indulged
in against the whole Apache race.... Greed and
avarice on the part of the whites—in other words,
the almighty dollar—is at the bottom of nine-tenths
of all our Indian trouble.”</p>

<p class="hang">Called by the Indians the “Gray Fox,” because of his weather
worn canvas suit and his skillful methods. Admired by them
also as “a common man who makes war like a big chief.”
He first organized the army pack-mule trains, and employed
Indians to fight Indians. He was noted for his dislike of
“show,” his strict honesty, his incessant hard work, his
great endurance, and his knowledge of Western animals
and Indian ways.</p>

at the battle of Lewisburg, West Virginia, where he was
wounded.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="APACHE">THE APACHE INDIANS</h2>
</div>


<p class="hang">A large collection of Indian tribes inhabiting the Southwest.
They first are mentioned in 1598 by the early Spanish explorers
in New Mexico.</p>

<p class="hang">The name “Apache” is derived from the Zuni word “Apachu,”
meaning “enemy.” Their own name was “Tinde (Tinneh)”
and “Dine (Dinde),” meaning “men” or “the people.”</p>

<p class="hang">They always were bitter enemies to the Spanish and Mexicans,
who offered high rewards in money for Apache scalps, and
enslaved captives. They were not openly hostile to the
Americans until, in 1857, a Mexican teamster employed by
the United States party surveying the Mexican boundary
line shot an Apache warrior without just cause. The survey
commissioner offered thirty dollars in payment, which was
refused, and the Apaches declared war.</p>

<p class="hang">In 1861 Cochise, chief of the Chiricahuas, who had been friendly,
was confined, on a false charge, by Lieutenant Bascom of
the army, at the army camp at Apache Pass, Arizona. He
cut his way to freedom. His brother and five others were
hanged by the Americans. Cochise hanged a white man, in
return, declared war, and almost captured the stage station
where the troops were fortified.</p>

<p class="hang">Beginning with the Civil War, the Apaches ravaged all southern
Arizona and the stage line in New Mexico also. Terrible
tortures were committed upon settlers and travelers.</p>

<p class="hang">In 1863 Mangas Coloradas (Red Sleeves), an old Mimbreño
chief related by marriage to Cochise, was treacherously imprisoned
and killed by soldiers, at Fort McLane, New Mexico.</p>

<p class="hang">Thenceforth the Apaches and whites in Arizona had little common
ground except that of “no quarter.” There was constant
fighting.</p>

<p class="hang">In March, 1871, a number of Arivaipa Apaches gathered peacefully
under the protection of Camp Grant are killed, captured
or put to flight by a vengeful party of Americans,
Mexicans and Papago Indians from Tucson.</p>

<p class="hang">In the fall of 1871 the Government peace commission tries to
adjust the differences between the white people and the
red. The Apaches are offered reservations and guaranteed
kind treatment. They have little faith in the words.</p>

<p class="hang">The Apaches, with the exception of the White Mountain in
Arizona and the Warm Spring in New Mexico, and some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
smaller bands, decline to gather upon reservations. In 1872
General O. O. Howard arrives as special peace commissioner,
and by his talks and actions wins the trust of the Indians.
The reservation idea seems a success. Cochise and his
Chiricahuas agree to remain in their own country of the
Dragoon Mountains, southern Arizona.</p>

<p class="hang">In the winter of 1872–73 General George Crook proceeds against
the outlaw Apaches of Arizona, especially the Tontos and
the Apache-Mohaves or Yavapais. His cavalry, infantry,
pack-trains and enlisted Indian scouts trail them down and
subdue them.</p>

<p class="hang">General Crook’s plans to make the Indians self-supporting on
their reservations appear to have brought peace to Arizona.</p>

<p class="hang">In 1874 the control of the reservations passes from the War
Department to the Indian Bureau. Reservations given to the
Indians “forever,” by the President, are reduced or abolished,
and various tribes are removed against their protests. Agents
prove dishonest, the Indians are not encouraged to work,
and are robbed of their rations.</p>

<p class="hang">The Chiricahuas are generally peaceful, although Mexico complains
that stock is being stolen and run across the border
into the reservation. Chief Cochise, who has kept his word
with General Howard, dies in 1874. Taza his son succeeds
him, as leader of the Chiricahua peace party, until his death
in 1876.</p>

<p class="hang">In April, 1876, whiskey is sold to some Chiricahuas, at a stage
station on the reservation. A fight ensues, and killings
occur. The great majority of the Chiricahuas refuse to join
in any outbreak.</p>

<p class="hang">In June, 1876, it is recommended by the governor of Arizona
that all the Chiricahuas be removed to the San Carlos reservation.
They do not wish to go, but the majority follow Taza
there. Chiefs Juh, Geronimo, and others escape.</p>

<p class="hang">The policy of the Indian Bureau contemplates putting all the
Apaches together upon the San Carlos reservation. The
White Mountain Apaches, who have voluntarily lived upon
the White Mountain reservation, their home land, adjacent,
and have supplied the government with scouts, decline to
go to the low country. When forced, they drift back again,
and finally are allowed to stay.</p>

<p class="hang">In 1877 the Warm Spring Apaches and the Geronimo Chiricahuas
who had taken refuge there are ordered from the Warm
Spring reservation in New Mexico to San Carlos. Some
escape; the remainder escape a little later. Thereafter, Chief
Victorio and his Warm Springs are constantly on the war-path,
out of Mexico.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p class="hang">In January, 1880, Chiefs Juh and Geronimo of the Chiricahuas
agree to stay upon the San Carlos reservation. In August
Victorio is killed by Mexican troops.</p>

<p class="hang">In September, 1881, Juh and Nah-che (a son of Cochise and a
lieutenant of Geronimo), break from the reservation, for
Mexico.</p>

<p class="hang">In April, 1882, Geronimo and Loco of the Chiricahuas follow.</p>

<p class="hang">General Crook is now recalled to the command in Arizona. He
talks with the Apaches on the reservations, finds a marked
state of mistrust and misunderstanding, and places his troops
to guard the border against the outlaws.</p>

<p class="hang">In March, 1883, Chato, or Flat-nose, a young captain of Geronimo’s
band, with twenty-six men breaks through, raids up
into New Mexico and Arizona, and murders settlers. With
forty cavalry, about two hundred Apache scouts, and pack-trains,
Crook overhauls the Chiricahuas in the wild Sierra
Madre Mountains of Mexico two hundred miles south of the
boundary, and persuades the whole band to return peaceably
to the reservation.</p>

<p class="hang">The Chiricahuas are placed under the control of General Crook,
and he locates them upon good land on the White Mountain
reservation. Both reservations are policed by the army.
The Apaches seem to be content, under the Crook plan that
they shall work for an independent living. In 1884 they raise
over four thousand tons of produce. There have been no
outbreaks.</p>

<p class="hang">In February, 1885, disagreements arise between the War Department
and the Interior Department, of which the Indian Bureau
is a function. General Crook’s powers are interfered
with by civil interests at Washington and in Arizona,
liquor is being permitted upon the reservations and the
Indians grow uneasy.</p>

<p class="hang">In May, 1885, after a controversy with the agent over the right
to dig an irrigating ditch, and having obtained a supply of
liquor, one hundred and twenty-four men, women and children
under Geronimo and Nah-che, his lieutenant, escape again into
Mexico. During their raids they kill seventy-three whites and
a number of Apache scouts.</p>

<p class="hang">General Crook secures an international agreement that United
States troops may operate in Mexico, and Mexican troops
in the United States, and sends a column on the trail of
Geronimo.</p>

<p class="hang">In March, 1886, Geronimo signifies that he desires to talk. The
general meets him, Chihuahua and other chiefs, and they accept
the terms of two years’ imprisonment, with the privilege
of the company of their families.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p class="hang">On the march north a vicious white man by the name of Tribollet
supplies whiskey to the Chiricahuas, at ten dollars (silver)
a gallon, alarms them with lies by himself and his unscrupulous
associates. Geronimo and Nah-che, with twenty men,
thirteen women and two children, disappear. Chihuahua and
eighty others remain.</p>

<p class="hang">The general’s action in making terms with the Chiricahuas, and
in not so guarding them that they would be forced to remain,
is indirectly censured by General Sheridan, commanding the
army. Crook explains that no other methods on his part
would have met with any success, under the circumstances,
and asks to be relieved from the command of the department.</p>

<p class="hang">In April, 1886, General Nelson A. Miles takes the command in
Arizona. He increases the number of heliostat signal stations,
discharges the reservation-Apache scouts (whom he
suspects of treachery), employs a few trailers from other
tribes, and by a very energetic campaign which permits
Geronimo no rest, in September induces his surrender upon
only the conditions that his life shall be spared and that
he shall be removed from Arizona.</p>

<p class="hang">Without delay the Geronimo and Nah-che remnant of hostiles,
and all the Chiricahua and Warm Spring Apaches, four
hundred in number, at the Fort Apache (White Mountain)
reservation, are removed, whether friendly or not, to Florida.
This is deemed the only practicable measure of freeing the
Southwest from the menace of Apache outbreaks. The
expenses of the Department of Arizona are lessened by
$1,000,000 a year.</p>

<p class="hang">The climate of Florida is unfavorable to the Apaches. Geronimo
complains that he and Nah-che had understood that their
families were to accompany them. Many of the Apaches
die from disease and homesickness.</p>

<p class="hang">In May, 1888, the Apaches are removed from Florida to Mt.
Vernon barracks, Alabama; and in October, 1894, as prisoners
of war to Fort Sill Military Reservation, Indian
Territory (now Oklahoma).</p>

<p class="hang">The principal reservations of the Arizona Apaches are the Fort
Apache and the San Carlos, each containing between two
and three thousand Indians. There are still over two hundred
of the Chiricahuas and Warm Springs at Fort Sill,
Oklahoma. Geronimo died February 17, 1909, at Fort Sill.
Nah-che succeeded him as chief.</p>

<p class="noi title">GENERAL CROOK AND<br />
THE FIGHTING APACHES</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="I">I<br />
<small>JIMMIE DUNN IS BADLY FOOLED</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Tinkle, tinkle,” placidly sounded the bell of the
old bell-wether, to prove that he and the other sheep
were grazing near at hand in the stiff brush.</p>

<p>“All right,” thought Jimmie Dunn, whose business
it was to keep tab on the whereabouts of that bell.</p>

<p>For this was a simmering hot summer afternoon
of the year 1870, far, far down in southern Arizona
Territory; and here on a hill-slope of the Pete Kitchen
big ranch about half-way between Tucson town and
the Mexican line Jimmie was lying upon his back under
a spreading crooked-branched mesquite tree, lazily
herding the ranch sheep.</p>

<p>The Kitchen ranch really was not Jimmie’s home.
He lived with his uncle Joe Felmer (not really his
uncle, either), who was the blacksmith for Camp
Grant, the United States army post ninety miles northward,
or fifty-five miles the other side of Tucson.</p>

<p>But the region close around Camp Grant was a
sandy pocket famous for fever and ague as well as
for other disagreeable features, such as scorpions, tarantulas,
ugly Gila monsters (thick, black, poisonous lizards),
heat and sand-storms; so that Joe had sent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
Jimmie down to their friend Pete Kitchen, on a
vacation.</p>

<p>Everybody, American, Mexican and Indian, in
southern Arizona, knew the Pete Kitchen ranch. It
was noted for its battles with the Apaches who, passing
back and forth on their raids out of the mountains of
Arizona and Mexico both, were likely to plunder and
kill, at any time. Sturdy Pete had not been driven
away yet, and did not propose to be driven away.</p>

<p>Jimmie himself was pretty well used to Apaches.
They prowled about Camp Grant, and attacked people
on the road from Tucson, and frequently the soldiers
rode out after them. Joe Felmer had married an
Apache woman, who was now dead; he spoke Apache
and Jimmie had picked up a number of the words; but
there were plenty of unfriendly Apaches who every
little while ran off with Joe’s mules or filled his hogs
with arrows.</p>

<p>On his back under the mesquite tree Jimmie was
not thinking of Apaches. He was idly surveying the
country—at the same time having an ear open to the
musical tinkle of the bell-wether, who told him where
the sheep were straying. And a delightful, dreamy
outlook this was, over all those quiet miles of mountain
and desert Arizona which only the Southern stage-line
traversed, and which, so thinly settled by white people,
the roving Apache Indians claimed as their own.</p>

<p>In his loose cotton shirt and ragged cotton trousers
Jimmie felt very comfortable. Presently his eyes
closed, his head drooped, and he nodded off, for forty
or so winks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>He dozed, he was certain, not more than five minutes;
or perhaps ten. Then he awakened with a sudden
start. Something had told him to awaken. He
sat up and looked to see that the sheep were all right.
He could not see one animal, but he heard the tinkle,
tinkle. He twisted about to find the old bell-wether—and
he gazed full into the grinning face of an Apache
boy!</p>

<p>The Apache boy, who appeared to be fourteen or
fifteen years old, was not more than five yards from
him—standing there beside a giant cactus, naked except
for a red cloth band about his forehead, and a
whitish cotton girdle about his middle, with the broad
ends hanging down before and behind, and regular
Apache moccasins reaching like leggins half way up
his thighs for protection against the brush: standing
there, grinning, in his left hand a bow, in his right
the wether’s bell!</p>

<p><em>He had been tinkling that bell!</em> And a smart trick
this was, too: to sneak up on the wether, get the bell,
and ring it to fool the herder while other Apaches drove
away the sheep!</p>

<p>For an instant Jimmie stared perfectly paralyzed
with astonishment. He could not believe his eyes.
Instead of a staid old tame sheep, here was a mischievous
young wild Apache! Then, trying to utter a shout,
up he sprang, to run. On the moment he heard a
sharp swish, the noose of an Apache’s rawhide rope
whipped about his shoulders, and right in mid-step he
was jerked backward so violently, head over heels,
that he had no time or breath for yelling a word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p>Barely had he landed topsy turvy in the brush when
a heavy body rushed for him, a supple dark hand was
clapped firmly over his mouth, and hauled upright he
was half dragged, half carried, through the mesquites
and the cactuses and around the slope of the hill.</p>

<p>Now he was flung, limp and dazed, aboard a pony,
his captor mounted into the saddle behind him, and
away they tore, while the brush beneath reeled by under
Jimmie’s swimming eyes.</p>

<p>This was a fast ride until the sheep were overtaken.
There they were, almost the whole flock, being
forced hotly onward by Apaches afoot and ahorse,
with other Apaches guarding the flanks. It looked like
a war party returning with plunder from Mexico. The
bands about the foreheads, the round rawhide helmets
that some wore, the thigh moccasins, the guns, bows,
lances and clubs, proved that they were a war party;
and they had a lot of loose horses and mules besides
the Pete Kitchen sheep.</p>

<p>Jimmie sighted another captive—a Mexican boy,
older than he, fastened upon a yellow mule led by an
Apache horseman.</p>

<p>A broad-shouldered, finely built Indian wearing an
Apache helmet with feathers sticking up from it, and
riding a white horse, evidently was the chief in
command.</p>

<p>The grip of the Apache who held Jimmie had
slackened. Jimmie managed to squirm ’round enough
to look up into the Apache’s face. In return he got a
grin, and two or three Apache words that said: “Good
boy. No fear.” These were common words with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
the “tame” Apaches who sometimes came into Camp
Grant or to Joe Felmer’s little ranch near by, so Jimmie
understood.</p>

<p>The country grew rougher and wilder and higher.
By the sun Jimmie knew that the course was generally
eastward, and he guessed that these were Chiricahua
Apaches.</p>

<p>The Apache Indians, as almost anybody in Arizona
could say off-hand, were divided into the Chiricahuas
and the Pinals and the Arivaipas and the Coyotes and
the White Mountains and the Apache-Mohaves and the
Apache-Yumas and the Tontos and the Mogollons, and
the Warm Spring Apaches and the Mimbres (of New
Mexico), and the Jicarillas (Heek-ah-ree-yahs) or
Basket Apaches, who never came into Arizona; and so
forth.</p>

<p>The Tontos and Pinals, who were outlaws, and the
Chiricahuas (Chee-ree-cah-wahs), who were hard,
thorough fighters, seemed to give the most trouble.
The Chiricahuas lived in the mountains of southern
Arizona and of northern Mexico.</p>

<p>The pines and cedars of the higher country were
reached before dusk. Not a tenth of the sheep had
come this far. The most of them had been left to die
from heat and exhaustion. Now having passed
through another of their favorite narrow canyons, the
Apaches halted, at dark, to camp beside a trickle of
water in a rocky little basin surrounded by crags and
timber.</p>

<p>This night Jimmie was forced to lie between two
Apache warriors, the one who had captured him, and
a comrade; and he fitted so closely that if he moved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
he would waken them. It was an uncomfortable bed,
there under a thin dirty strip of blanket, limited by
those greasy, warm bodies, and he was afraid to stir.
But he was so tired that he slept, anyway.</p>

<p>Very early in the morning the camp roused again.
Apaches when on a raid or when pursued were supposed
to travel on only one meal a day and with only
three hours’ rest out of the twenty-four. So now
on and on and on, through all kinds of rough country
they hastened, at steady gait and speaking rarely—Jimmie
riding a bareback horse.</p>

<p>In late afternoon they halted on the rim of a valley
so deep and wide that it was veiled in bluish-purple
haze. On a rocky point three of the Apaches started
a fire of dried grass, and sent up a smoke signal by
heaping pitchy pine cones upon the blaze.</p>

<p>Chewing twigs and sucking pebbles to keep their
mouths wet, the Apaches, talking together and watching,
waited, until a long distance across the valley,
whose brushy sides were thickly grown with the mescal,
or century plant cactuses, blooming in round stalks
twenty feet tall, a smoke column answered.</p>

<p>The Apaches tending to their own fire fed more
pine cones to it, and two of them rapidly clapped a
saddle-blanket on and off the smoke, and broke it into
puffs. The smoke column across the valley puffed in
reply.</p>

<p>The Apache boy who had played bell-wether pressed
to Jimmie’s horse.</p>

<p>“Chi-cowah,” he said, pointing. That was Apache
for “My home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>Now the party appeared satisfied. They scattered
their fire, and struck down into a narrow trail that
crossed the bottom of the valley. A peculiar sweetish
smell hung in the misted air. This, Jimmie guessed,
was from the steaming pits wherein the hearts of the
mescal, or century plants, were being roasted.</p>

<p>They glimpsed several squaws and children gathering
foodstuff in the brush. As they filed through a
little draw or rocky pass they were hailed loudly by
an Apache sentinel posted above. He could not be
seen, but the chief replied. The pass opened into a
grassy flat concealed by the usual high crags and timbered
ridges. Here was the Apache camp or rancheria
(ran-cher-ee-ah), located along a willow-bordered
creek.</p>

<p>Fifty or sixty of the Apache brush huts or jacals
were sprinkled all up and down the flat, and as soon
as the party entered, a tremendous chorus of welcome
sounded. Women shrieked, children screamed, dogs
barked and mules brayed. Right into the center of the
camp marched the party, and stopped.</p>

<p>A circle of staring women and children, and a few
men, surrounded. Other squaws bustled to take the
horses and mules from the dismounting warriors.
Jimmie was told to get off. Feeling lonesome and
miserable, he saw close in front of him a boy who did
not seem to be Indian at all, for he had fiery red
hair and brick-red freckles and only one eye, which
was blue!</p>

<p>Yes—a red-headed, one-eyed, blue-eyed boy, rather
runty, in only a whitish cotton girdle, and moccasins.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
Evidently he dressed that way—or undressed that way—all
the time, for his body and limbs were burned
darker than his face.</p>

<p>Jimmie was not granted much space for staring
back into that one blue eye. He was slapped upon the
shoulder, “Aqui (Here)!” grunted the chief, in Spanish,
and strode on through the circle. So Jimmie followed,
hobbling at best speed.</p>

<p>The chief went straight to a scrub-oak tree, with a
hut beneath it, and an Apache sitting in the shade of
it, on a deer hide before the hut. By the manner with
which Jimmie’s Apache spoke to the sitting Apache,
who did not rise, it was plain to be seen that the sitting
Apache was the principal chief, and that Jimmie’s
Apache was maybe only a captain.</p>

<p>They talked for a moment in Apache, too fast for
Jimmie to understand. Then the sitting chief, who
had been eying Jimmie sharply, addressed him in simple
Mexican-Spanish easy to catch.</p>

<p>He was not at all a bad-looking Apache. In fact,
he was about the finest Apache that Jimmie had ever
met: a broad-chested six-footer, like the captain chief,
but large eyed and kindly faced and dignified.</p>

<p>“What is your name?”</p>

<p>“James Dunn.”</p>

<p>“No Mexicano?”</p>

<p>“Americano,” corrected Jimmie proudly.</p>

<p>“Your father Pete Keetchen?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Where you live?”</p>

<p>“Camp Grant.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>“With soldiers?”</p>

<p>Jimmie reflected an instant. If he said “With Joe
Felmer,” then the chief would surely hold him as a
great prize, for Joe Felmer, Government scout as well
as post blacksmith, was an important enemy. So——</p>

<p>“Sometimes,” asserted Jimmie, which was true.</p>

<p>“Why on Keetchen rancho?”</p>

<p>“Tend to sheep.” And Jimmie blushed when he
recalled that he had been a great sheep-herder!</p>

<p>“Pete Keetchen your father?”</p>

<p>“No!” repeated Jimmie. “No father, no
mother.”</p>

<p>The head chief and the captain chief gazed at him
as though they would read his very thoughts. The
captain chief had such piercing dark eyes that they
bored clear through. But he was a sure-enough Apache,
with straight black hair and dark chocolate skin, darker
even than ordinary.</p>

<p>’Twas to be imagined that neither of the chiefs believed
Jimmie’s statements. They still suspected that
he belonged to Pete Kitchen.</p>

<p>The head chief spoke abruptly.</p>

<p>“You ’Pache now. Ugashé (U-gah-shay)—go!”</p>

<p>Jimmie knew that he was dismissed, and he turned
away. He was faint in the stomach and weak in the
knees, and he had no place in particular to go, until
he saw the Mexican boy captive sitting in the sun,
with his feet under him and his shanks high. Jimmie
seized upon the opportunity to talk with him, at last.</p>

<p>“What is your name?” he asked, squatting beside
him. All Americans in southern Arizona could speak<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
some Spanish; Mexican-Spanish was as common as
English.</p>

<p>“Maria Jilda Grijalba (Maree-ah Heel-dah Gree-hal-bah).”</p>

<p>“Where did you live?”</p>

<p>“In Sonora” (which was in Mexico). “Where
did you live?”</p>

<p>“Camp Grant—American fort, Arizona.”</p>

<p>“How far?”</p>

<p>Jimmie shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Do not know.”</p>

<p>“You do not live on the rancho?”</p>

<p>“For little while.”</p>

<p>“You have father, mother?”</p>

<p>“No. Apaches kill them.”</p>

<p>“My father, mother, brothers, sisters, all killed,”
lamented Maria, weeping. “Alas! All killed, by
Apaches.”</p>

<p>“We run off, pretty soon?” proposed Jimmie.</p>

<p>“No!” opposed Maria, in much alarm. “Must
stay. Be Apaches. They not let us run off. Big
country. Get lost and die. Get caught and be killed.”</p>

<p>But Jimmie had made up his mind that he was not
going to be an Apache; he would escape if he could.
Or maybe he would be rescued.</p>

<p>However, here came the captain chief, and the bell-wether
Apache boy, and the strange red-headed boy
with the one blue eye.</p>

<p>“Ugashé!” roughly ordered the captain chief,
of Maria. Poor Maria obediently arose and shuffled
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p>The captain spoke to Jimmie, and smiled. He,
also was a fine-looking Apache: almost six feet tall
and straight and sinewy, with square face and thin,
determined lips, and those extraordinary sharp eyes.</p>

<p>Jimmie stood up.</p>

<p>“Chi-kis-n,” said the captain, and nodded aside at
the bell-wether boy.</p>

<p>“Chi-kis-n” was Apache for “my brother.” The
Apache boy grinned and held out his hand.</p>

<p>“Chi-kis-n,” he greeted.</p>

<p>The red-headed, one-eyed boy explained in Spanish.</p>

<p>“Your name Boy-who-falls-asleep, his name Nah-che.
But you must call him chi-kis-n—my brother.”</p>

<p>“Muchos gratias (Many thanks),” answered
Jimmie, shaking hands with Nah-che. Nah-che was
a stocky, round-faced boy, and Jimmie liked him in
spite of that trick with the sheep bell.</p>

<p>“The chief’s name is Go-yath-lay,” continued the
red-headed boy. “He is war-captain of the Chiricahua.
Nah-che is son of Cochise, head chief.”</p>

<p>The war captain, who had been listening intently,
trying to understand the words, nodded, and spoke
again in Apache.</p>

<p>“Your chi-kis-n will show you,” translated the red-headed
boy, who knew Spanish and Apache both.</p>

<p>“Aqui (Here),” bade Nah-che: and Jimmie followed
him to one of those regulation Apache jacals—a
low round-topped hut made from willow branches stuck
in a circle and bent over to fasten together, with pieces
of deer hide and cow hide laid to cover the framework
of the sides, and flat bundles of brush to thatch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
the roof. The jacals resembled dirty white bowls
bottom-up. Each had a little opening, as a door to be
entered only by stooping half double.</p>

<p>Before the hut an Apache woman in a loose cotton
waist worn outside a draggled calico skirt was busy
cooking. She stirred the contents of an iron kettle, set
upon a bed of coals in a small shallow pit. She threw
back her long, coarse black hair and scanned Jimmie
curiously while Nah-che spoke a few words to her.</p>

<p>Then repeating the title “chi-kis-n” Nah-che strolled
away. The woman smiled broadly at Jimmie, took
him by the arm, and talking to him led him inside the
hut. The earth had been dug out, there, so that they
might stand, in the middle, and not strike their heads
on the ceiling.</p>

<p>The woman made Jimmie remove his trousers and
shoes; and leaving him his ragged shirt tossed to him
a pair of old moccasins.</p>

<p>Again out-doors, she gave him a mess of the stew,
in a gourd bowl. The stew was corn and beans cooked
together, and was very good indeed, to a hungry boy.</p>

<p>“Go,” she signed. “Come back at night.”</p>

<p>Here in the open, Jimmie felt rather odd, with nothing
on but his shirt and moccasins. Still, most of the
boys and girls of his age, in the village, had even less on.
They were brown, though, and he was white, which
seemed to make a difference.</p>

<p>Some of the boys were playing at what appeared
to be hide-and-seek amidst the brush and trees and
rocks; others were shooting with bows and arrows.
The little girls had dolls, of rags, and stuffed, painted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
buckskin. They all viewed him out of their sparkling
black eyes, and the girls giggled the same as white girls.</p>

<p>Jimmie’s squaw shoved him from behind.</p>

<p>“U-ga-shé!” she ordered. “Go!”</p>

<p>After all, thought Jimmie, if he had to live here
for a while, he might better pretend to enjoy himself,
until he got a good chance to escape. So he boldly
joined in the game of hide-and-seek. At first everybody
there let him alone. But he chased around, with
the others, his shirt flapping, and soon he was one of
the “gang” and was being shouted at in Apache.</p>

<p>The one-eyed boy and Nah-che and several others
of that age stayed by themselves, playing a game with
raw-hide cards, and talking. They were too old for
foolishness.</p>

<p>This night Jimmie slept in the squaw’s hut. There
was a feast and dance, judging by the noise that he
heard when awake. Nah-che came in late. In the
morning the red-headed boy went away on foot with
three Apaches who evidently had been visitors at the
village; and as he did not return during the day, he
probably belonged somewhere else, himself.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="II">II<br />
<small>JIMMIE LEARNS TO BE APACHE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>These were the principal band of the Cho-kon-en
Apaches who were called Chiricahua (“Great Mountain”)
Apaches because of the Chiricahua Mountains
amidst which they lived. But Cho-kon-en was their
own name.</p>

<p>The pleasant-faced Cochise was the head chief.
He was about fifty-five years old. The captain Go-yath-lay
or “One-who-yawns” was the war chief.
He was forty years old. The Mexicans whom he
had fought had given him the name Geronimo (Her-<em>on</em>-i-mo),
which is Spanish for Jerome.</p>

<p>There were other bands of Chiricahuas, under other
chiefs—Na-na and Chihuahua (Chi-wah-wah) and
Loco, and so forth. Na-na was the oldest of all; he
was nearly eighty, and had been wounded many times
in battle—yes, as many as fifteen times. Chihuahua
was stout and good-natured. Loco was thin and quite
bow-legged.</p>

<p>In the Sierra Madre Mountains of Mexico, which
were the south end of the Chiricahua Range, were the
Nedni Apaches, under old Chief Juh, or “Whoa.”
Chief Cochise and Chief Juh frequently went to war
together against the Mexicans.</p>

<p>Northeastward, or in western New Mexico lived
the Chi-hen-ne—the Ojo Caliente (Oho Cal-i-en-te) or
Warm Spring Apaches, under Chief Victorio. With
Chief Victorio’s people the Cochise people had long
been as brothers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>The woman who had charge of Jimmie was Nah-da-ste.
She was a sister of Geronimo. Her husband
had been killed in battle with the Mexicans. The
warrior who had captured Jimmie was Geronimo’s
younger brother Porico, or “White Horse.”</p>

<p>Nah-che, Jimmie’s chi-kis-n, was the youngest son
of Chief Cochise. Geronimo the war chief liked him
very much. His name meant “meddlesome,” for he
had been a mischievous baby. In about three years, or
when he was seventeen, if he had proved himself
worthy in the hunt and on the long trail, he would
be admitted into the councils as a warrior.</p>

<p>The same with another boy, Chato. He was called
Chato, or “Flat-nose,” because he had been kicked
in the face by a mule.</p>

<p>Taza, Nah-che’s elder brother, already was a warrior
and would be head chief, probably, after Cochise
his father died. But that was not certain; head chiefs
were elected and not born.</p>

<p>As for the red-headed, one-eyed blue-eyed boy——</p>

<p>“His name is Red-head,” said Nah-che. “He is
not one of us. He is part Mexican and part American.
He was captured a long time ago by some of our men,
but he lives with the White Mountains now, in the
north. The White Mountains are at peace, on their
land where the new American fort is being built.”</p>

<p>Jimmie rapidly learned Apache, although many of
the Chiricahuas spoke Spanish. He soon had lost his
shirt, and went about with only a rag around his waist.
Everybody in the Cochise camp was kind to him. He
was an Apache boy, now. The Apaches never whipped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
their children, nor punished them in any way except
by scolding.</p>

<p>The little children were made to help in the fields
where corn and squash and beans and melons were
raised; and went with their mothers to gather seeds
and berries and acorns and mescal—for the Apaches
ate curious things.</p>

<p>The girls played with dolls, and at housekeeping
and tended to the babies, of which there were many.
The boys of nine and ten, Jimmie’s age, and over,
worked some, but they were encouraged to use the bow
and arrow, and throw the lance, and practice at war
and at the hunt, so as to train them as warriors and
to strengthen their muscles.</p>

<p>The war game was the best sport. Some of the
boys pretended to be Mexicans. The others remained
Apaches. The “Mexicans” were given a head-start,
into the brush and timber, and the “Apaches” set
out to find their trail and to surprise them.</p>

<p>Although the “Mexicans” did everything they
might think of, to conceal their tracks and to get away,
they always were discovered. Then by running and
sneaking and crawling flat with grass and cactus tied
to their heads the “Apaches” proceeded to ambush the
“Mexicans.” Then the “Apaches” yelled and shot
fast with light arrows, and the “Mexicans” were
killed or captured.</p>

<p>Turkeys were caught by running after them up hill
and down until they were so tired that they could not
fly, and were killed by a blow from a club on the neck.
Rabbits were chased, too, and surrounded by a circle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
of boys armed with bows and clubs; and they, too,
were killed.</p>

<p>All these sports made the Apache boys fleet of foot
and quick of eye and arm, and very strong in lungs and
legs.</p>

<p>The Apaches had curious customs as well as curious
food.</p>

<p>“You must never ask a Tinneh (‘Tinneh’ was the
Apache’s own title; it meant ‘man’) his name,” explained
Nah-che. “Only somebody else may speak it.
If he spoke it, he would have bad luck.”</p>

<p>And——</p>

<p>“You must never speak of the bear or the mule or
the snake or the lightning unless you say Ostin Shosh
(Old Man Bear), or Ostin Mule or Ostin Snake or
Ostin lightning. It is not well to talk about them
or the owl. They are medicine.”</p>

<p>And——</p>

<p>“After you are married you must not look upon
the face of your wife’s mother. You must avoid meeting
her or speaking to her. You must hide your face
or turn your back, or you will be disrespectful.”</p>

<p>And——</p>

<p>“You must not eat fish meat, or the meat of the
pig. They are bad.”</p>

<p>And——</p>

<p>“When anyone dies we give away everything of his
that we don’t burn. If that was not done, then there
might be persons of bad hearts who would wish a
relative to die so that they would get his property.”</p>

<p>And——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p>“When I go on the trail as a warrior, for the first
four times I must not touch my lips to water. I must
drink through a hollow reed, or I will spoil the luck of
the whole party. And I must not scratch my head
with my fingers. I must use a scratch stick.”</p>

<p>War parties went out frequently, sometimes under
Geronimo, sometimes under Cochise also. The warriors
marched on foot, as a rule, because then they
could climb and hide better. On foot an Apache could
travel forty to seventy-five miles at a stretch, which
was as much as a horse could do. No white man could
equal an Apache, in covering rough country and desert
country.</p>

<p>The parties were sent out mainly against the Mexicans
of Mexico, to get plunder, although the Chiricahuas
had no love for the Americans, either, Nah-che
explained again.</p>

<p>He was sitting, pulling the hairs from his chin and
cheeks with a pair of bone tweezers. It was unmanly
for a warrior to have any hair on his face, and Nah-che
expected to be a warrior after he had made four war-trails.
Four was the lucky number, with the Apaches.</p>

<p>“We hate the Mexicans. They are bad,” said
Nah-che. “They kill our women and children, and
pay for scalps. With the Americans it is like this:</p>

<p>“When they first came into our country we were
friendly to them. We saw that they were different
from the Mexicans, and they had been at war with the
Mexicans, too. They shot one of us, and offered to
pay a little something, which was not punishment
enough. Still we did not stay at war with them.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
Cochise made a camp near the American wagon-road
at Apache Pass, where Camp Bowie is now, and traded,
and sold wood. One time a Mexican woman and her
baby were stolen by some bad Indians from an American,
and the Chiricahua were asked to return them.
We did not have them, or know anything about them,
but Cochise and Mangas Coloradas of the Mimbreño
Apaches and some other chiefs went with a white flag
to meet a young American war chief at Apache Pass,
and talk.</p>

<p>“When they got there the American chief surrounded
them with his soldiers and told them that they
would be kept shut in a tent until they sent and got
the baby and woman. They decided they would rather
be killed than be kept prisoners. So they drew their
knives, and Cochise cut a hole through the back of the
tent, and there was a fight. Several were killed. But
Cochise and Mangas Coloradas escaped. Cochise was
wounded in the knee by a gun knife (bayonet). The
Americans hung his brother and five others, by the
neck, and Cochise hung an American by the neck;
and he and Mangas Coloradas called all their warriors
and nearly captured the Americans. The young American
captain had acted very foolish.</p>

<p>“After two or three years Mangas Coloradas (this
was Spanish for ‘Red Sleeves’) grew tired of
fighting. He was badly wounded, and he sent word
that he would like to treat for peace. The Americans
told him to come in with his people. Cochise had
married his sister, and we and the Mimbreños often
helped each other, and now Cochise advised him not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
to trust the word of the Americans. But Mangas
Coloradas went to an American fort in New Mexico.</p>

<p>“Then they seized him and put him into a little
house with only one window, high up. The soldiers
scowled at him; so that when he was put into the little
house he said to himself: ‘This is my end. I shall
never again hunt through the valleys and mountains of
my people.’ And that was so. This night while he
was asleep somebody from outside threw a big rock
down on his chest—or else a soldier guard punched
him with a hot knife on the end of a gun. We do
not know. Anyway, he was much frightened. He ran
about, trying to climb out and fight with his hands
and then the soldiers shot him many times, and he died.</p>

<p>“Now you see that the Chiricahua cannot be friends
with the Americans any more than with the Mexicans,
and it is so with other Tinneh. The Warm Springs
are friendly, because Chief Victorio thinks that is wise;
and the Sierra Blanca (White Mountains) have agreed
not to fight. But they have not lost chiefs and brothers
like we have.”</p>

<p>This was the way the Chiricahua Apaches thought.
But of course there were two sides to the quarrel.
Joe Felmer and Pete Kitchen and other pioneers had
claimed that old Mangas Coloradas had been a regular
bandit who never intended to stay at peace. He had
tortured and killed men and women and children, and
was determined to drive all the Americans out of the
country. Once he had been captured by miners and
tied up and whipped, which had made him worse.</p>

<p>He had lived to be seventy years old, and although<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
even Pete Kitchen did not wholly approve of the manner
with which he had been disposed of, it was a great
relief to have him out of the way. Maybe he might
have been educated to stay at peace, and maybe not.</p>

<p>But now that the Chiricahuas hated the Americans
and Mexicans both, Jimmie saw little chance of escape.</p>

<p>Maria the Mexican boy had settled down to be an
Apache. All his folks had been killed, and he said
that he might as well live with the Apaches. He had
plenty to eat and little to do; and he thought that he
would marry an Apache girl, when he was old enough,
and stay Apache.</p>

<p>The Red-head boy who lived with the White Mountain
Apaches came in once or twice, to visit, while
out hunting or just scouting around. He could not
speak English. His father had been Irish and his
mother Mexican, and Spanish had been the only language
used in his home. Since the Apaches had captured
him eight or nine years ago he had learned
Apache, too.</p>

<p>“Are you going to stay Apache, Red-head?” asked
Jimmie.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Red-head, in Apache. “I’ll stay
with the White Mountains, but I don’t like the Chiricahua.
It is no use for them to fight the Americans.
Besides, they killed my father and mother. Are you
going to be a Chiricahua, Boy-who-sleeps?”</p>

<p>Jimmie shook his head.</p>

<p>“No. I am American. I don’t want to be anything
but American. I’m a white boy.”</p>

<p>“That is good,” approved Red-head. He was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
snappy, energetic boy, built low to the ground, and
with his red hair and freckled face and one bright
blue eye looked very nervy. “I like the Americans.
Some day I’ll be a scout with the American soldiers.
The White Mountain Apaches are good Apaches.
Chief Pedro is wise. He knows that it is no use to fight
the Americans. It is better to live at peace with them,
and raise corn, and hunt, and be given food and clothes.
That is easier than fighting and starving and losing
warriors. The Americans are too many, and are well
armed. The Chiricahua have bad hearts and will all
be killed. You ought to leave them.”</p>

<p>“I can’t,” replied Jimmie. “I don’t know where
to go.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Red-head, winking with his one
shrewd blue eye, “wait and maybe I’ll help you. But
don’t tell anybody about my talk with you.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="III">III<br />
<small>THE RED-HEAD TURNS UP</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Jimmie had been with the Cochise Chiricahuas
about a year, as he reckoned, because winter (and not a
cold winter) had passed, and the yuccas, or Spanish-bayonet
cactuses, and the mescal, or century plant cactuses,
were again in bloom with their tall, stately plumes
of white, which indicated May.</p>

<p>All this time nobody had come looking for him,
and he did not know what was going on outside—at
Pete Kitchen’s or at Tucson or at Camp Grant or at
Joe Felmer’s, or anywhere.</p>

<p>All the news was Apache news; gossip about hunting
and raids, and cowardly Mexicans and stupid
Americans.</p>

<p>Camps had been changed frequently, for the Chiricahuas
did not remain long in any one spot. He had
not seen Red-head in several months. According to
Nah-che the soldiers were getting more numerous, and
were fighting all the Apaches—the Chiricahuas and the
Tontos and the Yavapais or Apache-Mohaves and the
Mogollons: all who would not settle down at peace
like the White Mountains and the Warm Springs.</p>

<p>Part of the winter had been spent in Mexico, but
just now the camp had been located again amidst the
Chiricahua Mountains. Most of the warriors were out
on a big raid, under Cochise and Geronimo. They had
not taken any of the older boys. By this it looked as
though they were going into American country, where
they might meet the soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>Nah-che admitted as much. He said that report
had come of a killing of friendly Apaches at Camp
Grant, so it was useless to trust the White-eyes (as the
Americans were called); they were the enemies of the
Apaches, and Cochise had gone to kill all the Mexicans
and Americans that he could find, down there.</p>

<p>Jimmie felt anxious. He well knew how cunning
and bold the Cochise Chiricahuas were. They had
plenty of arms, including guns that they had captured.
They were particularly eager to kill a young American
war-captain who had been leading soldiers upon their
trail.</p>

<p>“Was he a new young war-captain?”</p>

<p>“No, he was an old young war-captain—a horse
chief. He had killed Apaches out of Tucson and Camp
Grant both.”</p>

<p>As Nah-che would not talk any more about him,
Jimmie might only guess. But all the young officers in
the First and the Third Cavalry at Camp Grant had
been brave.</p>

<p>The Cochise and Geronimo party were gone more
than half a moon before word arrived from them.
Then, one morning, two runners or messengers, Porico
(“White Horse”), who was Geronimo’s brother, and
Hal-zay, who was a half-brother to Nah-che, appeared.
They had traveled hard and were tired, but they
brought exciting news.</p>

<p>The Chiricahuas had ambushed twenty American
soldiers and scouts at the Bear Springs in the Mestinez
(Mustang) Mountains only a day’s march east from
Tucson; had killed six of them, maybe more, and had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
driven the rest back clear into Camp Crittenden, southeast
of Tucson; would have surrounded and killed
them, too, had they not fought so skillfully.</p>

<p>A few Chiricahuas had been killed, but among the
first to fall, of the Americans, was the young horse
chief who had given the Chiricahuas so much trouble.
They had taken his clothes and other trophies, and
had easily escaped to the Sierra Madre Mountains of
Mexico.</p>

<p>Cochise was going to stay there for a time, until the
soldiers quit trying to trail him. Then he would come
north.</p>

<p>The old squaws in the rancheria immediately lay
flat upon their stomachs and screeched and wailed,
mourning the warriors who had fallen. This was
Apache custom. But the camp on the whole was happy
and Jimmie was the only truly sad member. He was
not an Apache; he was an American, even though he
did not look much like a white boy, now, save for his
eyes and hair.</p>

<p>The camp was moved, to guard against a surprise
from the soldiers of the American forts. After another
half a moon the war party came in and were given
a great welcome. They had eaten most of the captured
cavalry horses, but they brought some of the
other plunder. Taza was wearing the flannel shirt of
the young officer.</p>

<p>He was very proud of it. It was a blue shirt, with
the straps of a first lieutenant sewed upon the shoulders.
Jimmie recognized these, because he knew army uniforms.
The shirt was passed about. Inside the neck<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
had been stitched a little tag, bearing the letters “H.
B. C.” printed on it.</p>

<p>Oh! This was Lieutenant Cushing’s shirt, then!
His initials were H. B. C., for Howard B. Cushing; and
he was a first lieutenant, and he had commanded lots
of detachments out of Camp Grant, against the
Apaches. He was a terrific fighter, too, and one of
the very best officers on a trail. Jimmie remembered
him well. All southern Arizona knew of Lieutenant
Howard B. Cushing of the Third Cavalry. He had
served through the Civil War; one of his brothers had
been killed at Gettysburg and another, as a lieutenant
in the navy, had blown up the Confederate iron-clad
Albemarle by poking it with a bomb attached to a long
pole.</p>

<p>This Lieutenant Cushing of the Third Cavalry was
just as brave. The Apaches had had good reason to
fear him. No wonder they rejoiced, now that they
had ambushed him and wiped him out.</p>

<p>Nah-che saw Jimmie gulp in his throat. Nah-che
had keen eyes.</p>

<p>“You know him?” asked Nah-che.</p>

<p>“Friend,” answered Jimmie, turning away.</p>

<p>“He was a brave captain,” volunteered Nah-che.
“He fought hard. But in war brave men die.”</p>

<p>Jimmie longed for the Red-head to take him away;
or for soldiers or scouts to attack the camp and rescue
him.</p>

<p>The killing of Lieutenant Cushing encouraged the
Chiricahuas. Cochise had talks with Chiefs Loco and
Chihuahua, and with Chief Nana who was with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
Warm Spring band and helping the Chiricahuas. Parties
were being sent out constantly; some of the captains
took their families, Maria was traded to Chief Nana,
and soon the main Chiricahua camp was much smaller.</p>

<p>One day Nah-che, who had been away with Geronimo,
came hurrying in with orders for the camp to be
moved again.</p>

<p>“There are soldiers marching this way,” he reported,
breathless, and big with his news. “They
struck us when we were eating, in the medicine springs
valley near the Sierra Bonita. We were bringing meat
up from Mexico, but we left it. We have seen signal
fires telling us of other soldiers. Geronimo says to go
at once to the next place-we-know-of.”</p>

<p>Instantly the camp was all confusion. The old
men shouted, the women ran around screeching and
gathering their household things, children scampered
and screamed, dogs yelped. The frameworks of the
huts were set afire, and leaving in the smoke the Chiricahuas
hustled out for other quarters.</p>

<p>They made a queer procession. The old men
stoutly hobbled by aid of long staffs or “walking-sticks”;
the women were laden with huge bundles slung
to their backs by means of straps about their foreheads,
and with babies tucked into their shawls or bound
in wicker cradles; ponies had been packed with baskets;
the smaller children rode atop, but the strong boys
and girls walked. Jimmie and the boys of his age were
not obliged to carry anything.</p>

<p>Through canyon and across valley, into brush and
timber, up slope and down, they toiled, led by old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
Cha-dah, who was the camp tatah or chief. Every
so often the tatah and the other old men in advance
halted, and stuck their staffs into the ground, and
waited. Here everybody rested, for a brief space.
By this system many miles were covered before camp
was established, at evening, and all might eat and
sleep.</p>

<p>Jimmie, lying wrapped in a piece of blanket near
Nah-che, under a pine tree, was awakened in the night
by a hand firmly pressed upon his forehead. The
pressure warned him not to stir, so he only stared up—and
in the star-lighted dimness he saw the one bright
eye of Red-head beaming down from close above him.</p>

<p>Red-head was squatting, waiting. Now he removed
his hand slowly, and beckoned with his finger,
and silently backed away.</p>

<p>This was enough for Jimmie. What Red-head
was doing here, on a sudden, after a long absence, he
did not delay to reason out, but began cautiously to
slip from his blanketing.</p>

<p>First he drew away, crouched; then on hands and
knees; then, stooping, and carefully setting foot before
foot, testing the ground lest a twig snap. From tree to
tree he stole, until he was beyond the camp—and on a
sudden, again, Red-head arose right in front of him.</p>

<p>That was good! Now he followed behind the Red-head’s
soundless course, swiftly, straight away, until
Red-head stopped.</p>

<p>“Do you want to escape?” asked Red-head. He
carried a bow and quiver, and wore only a cloth about
his middle, and moccasins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“If you’ll travel fast, I’ll take you,” said Red-head.
“Soldiers are coming. If we don’t find them
you can go to Chief Pedro of the White Mountains.
The Chiricahua never visit there, because of the fort.”</p>

<p>“Bueno (Good),” approved Jimmie.</p>

<p>Red-head set out at a trot and rapid walk, but Jimmie
kept right in his wake. Jimmie’s legs were as
strong as those of Red-head; his training in the Apache
games stood by him. On and on and on they hastened,
without a word, through the night, amidst timber, and
across open flats, and down cactus hills and up again.</p>

<p>Red-head seemed to know what he was about, but
Jimmie of course was completely lost. Not until the
dusk had thinned and the eastern sky was pink did
Red-head halt, at a spring which had made the ground
mushy in a little hollow among rocks and cedars.</p>

<p>“Drink, eat, rest,” he said. He grinned with
his freckled face, his long red hair was damp with
sweat. “You did well, Boy-who-sleeps. One more
travel and they cannot catch us. Wait.”</p>

<p>He fitted an arrow to his bow-string and stepped
aside, hunting. Jimmie flung himself down, drank, and
lay flat, resting. The sky was pink as far as over-head,
he might glimpse Red-head moving silently among the
cedars; saw him shoot an arrow; and presently Red-head
returned with two rabbits.</p>

<p>They started a fire by twirling a pointed stick set
upon a flat piece of wood until the dust smoked; then
they blew upon the dust and some bark tinder until
there was a glow. Then they cooked the rabbits over
dry cedar that made no smoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<p>First by the stars and later by the pink east Jimmie
knew that they had been traveling toward the north.
Now Red-head explained. Some of his talk was
Apache and some was Spanish-Mexican. He used
whichever language came the easier.</p>

<p>“We will not go straight to Camp Apache in the
country where the White Mountains are,” he said. “It
is better that we go round-about. If the Chiricahua
see that we are going to Camp Apache that might make
trouble. They would say that the White Mountains
stole you, and some time they might capture <em>me</em>. Now
if they try to follow us, we will fool them.</p>

<p>“I will tell you about the soldiers. There is a new
American comandante. He has come to Tucson, to
fight the bad Indians. He is leading out a great lot
of horse soldiers and white scouts and tame-Indian
scouts—Navahos and Papagos and Yaquis and
Apaches, too—and wagons and pack-mules. He has
been at Camp Bowie, and he is marching north to
Camp Apache, but he may not stay. The White Mountains
have heard this from runners. The runners say
that he is a wonderful comandante, who knows everything
but asks many questions. Shall we try to find
him, Boy-who-sleeps? I think that now is a good
chance, while the Chiricahua are hiding.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to live with the Chiricahuas,”
asserted Jimmie. “I hate them. They kill my
friends. I’m not an Indian. I’m white.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether I’m American or Mexican
or Indian,” grinned Red-head. “I can be anything.
What is your American name, Boy-who-sleeps? I will
call you by it. We will quit being Apache.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>“James MacGregor Dunn, but everybody called
me Jimmie.”</p>

<p>“Inju (good),” grunted Red-head, in Apache.
“I am called Micky Free by the soldiers at Camp
Apache. You shall call me Micky, and I shall call you
Cheemie.”</p>

<p>“How did you lose your eye, Micky?”</p>

<p>“By a deer. Three or four years ago I shot a deer
with an arrow, and knocked him down. I thought I
had killed him, but when I ran and grabbed his head
he fought me and struck me with his horn in the eye.
Old Miguel has only one eye, too. He lost that in
battle.”</p>

<p>“Who is old Miguel?”</p>

<p>“He is a White Mountain chief. There are Miguel
and Pedro and old Es-ki-tis-tsla and Pi-to-ne. They
are for peace.”</p>

<p>“Inju,” grunted Jimmie.</p>

<p>While they rested and ate and drank, Micky kept
a sharp look-out. Every now and again he mounted
upon a rocky ledge and lay there, peering.</p>

<p>“I see smokes,” he said, coming down the last
time. “I do not think they are meant for us. The
Chiricahua are signaling to each other. But we had
better go on, Cheemie, to a cave I know of. We will
sleep.”</p>

<p>Yes, there were smokes, far back on their trail:
smokes that signaled “enemies.” This was well, because
with enemies around, the Chiricahuas would not
risk following the trail of a boy. So that noon Jimmie
and Micky slept in Micky’s cave, which was concealed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
high up in the side of a canyon. They entered it from
above. From the mouth they might see a long distance.</p>

<p>“In two days we shall cross the Tonto country,”
remarked Micky. “That is where we turn east for
Camp Apache and the White Mountains. We will have
to be very careful again. The Tonto are bad people.
They are outlaws. When an Apache gets bad, he
joins the Tonto.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IV">IV<br />
<small>THE CANVAS SUIT MAN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The country was steadily growing wilder, with
much large timber. For two days Micky had been
leading on and on. The Chiricahuas did not seem to
be pursuing, and Jimmie was certain that he had escaped
from them. He wished that he might have said
good-by to good Nah-da-ste, who had taken care of
him; and to his friends Nah-che and Chato, and some
others; but of course that had not been possible. They
might have known that he could not stay being an
Apache.</p>

<p>Now on this the third day from the cave Micky
suddenly stopped short and examined an object beside
him. They had been following just below a gravelly
ridge, so as to be out of sight. Yuccas and bunchy grass
grew here, and a few cedars, and the sun was warm.</p>

<p>“Tonto sign,” spoke Micky, pointing.</p>

<p>It was a band of dried grass knotted around a yucca
leaf. Only eyes like those of Micky would have seen
it; but Micky saw everything.</p>

<p>“How do you know, Micky?”</p>

<p>“Because I know,” answered Micky. “That is the
way the Tonto tie their grass. A White Mountain
would have tied different, and so would a Chiricahua
or a Pinal. And the same with piling stones or writing
signs on rocks or bark. It means a Tonto war party
has passed here, and tells other Tonto to follow. See—there
is the trail.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>“Shall we hide, Micky?”</p>

<p>“No. The trail was made early this morning. It
is an old trail. See, Cheemie? You have lived with
the Chiricahua and you ought to know. There is a
broken twig, where it was stepped on, and the leaves
are wilted. The sap is done flowing. I think we’d better
follow and see where those Tonto are going, so
we won’t run into them.”</p>

<p>The trail proceeded up the gravelly ridge, where
moccasin prints were plain, and over, and through
among cedars of a flat mesa; and suddenly Jimmie
fairly gasped for breath. They had come out upon the
edge of a great, broad, deep valley lying like a green
basin; it was so deep that the trees in it looked like
shrubs, and the farther edge was veiled in purple mist.</p>

<p>“Tonto home,” said Micky. “Down in there the
Tonto live, where they can hide. Up here is Mogollon
country. It is all a flat mountain top, on the Sierra
Mogollon. We shall see many big pine trees soon.
When we find where this Tonto trail goes we had better
turn back.”</p>

<p>The trail skirted the dizzy edge; then it veered inland,
and was joined by another trail, and presently the
joined trails made straight into a tremendous forest.
The trees were all pines; they stood up tall and stately,
and under them the ground was clean, except for the
needles and the low grass and flowers. Throughout the
long aisles flecked by the sun not a thing moved. It
was a silent forest.</p>

<p>Micky and Jimmie trotted fast, their eyes upon the
trail, or searching ahead. Now it was past noon.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
Once in a while the view opened into the great Tonto
Basin; and again there was only the timber, with the
serried trunks extending on every side. In such a
forest, and when gazing into such a basin, a boy felt
small.</p>

<p>About an hour or an hour and a half after noon
Micky, who was just before, stopped short once more—stopped
so quickly that he stood with one foot uplifted.
He signed “Come,” and Jimmie came on.</p>

<p>“Horse tracks now, Cheemie. American horses.
Mules, too. American soldiers.”</p>

<p>This was a larger trail; the pine needles were imprinted
with many hoof marks. The horses had been
ridden four abreast—yes, five and six abreast, so that
the trail lay broadly. They were shod horses, which
meant cavalry horses, because the Apache horses were
not shod, save with buckskin boots in cactus country.
No Apaches rode four or five abreast, anyway. The
mule prints were smaller and rounder; and the prints
cut deeper, showing that the mules had been laden:
pack-mules.</p>

<p>Hah! Micky studied the new trail. The Tontos,
too, had paused and studied it.</p>

<p>“These are some of the soldiers I spoke of, I
think,” finally declared Micky. “They have been at
Camp Apache, maybe. Anyhow, they are going away
from it. Maybe the Tonto will attack them. What
do you say to do, Cheemie? My heart tells me we have
gone far enough. Shall we turn back, for Camp
Apache?”</p>

<p>“I’d rather try to find the soldiers, Micky.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<p>“I will take you to Camp Apache. There are soldiers
at Camp Apache; and the White Mountains will
be good to you if the soldiers don’t want you. We
will all be chi-kis-n to you.”</p>

<p>“Are you afraid of these soldiers, Micky?”</p>

<p>“No; but I am afraid of the Tonto. Besides, I live
with Chief Pedro’s people on the reservation near Camp
Apache. I have no business off in this other direction.”</p>

<p>“I have, though,” answered Jimmie. “I live at
Camp Grant. Maybe these soldiers are marching back
to Camp Grant, or Tucson, and they’ll take me there.”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied Micky, “I will follow with you,
Cheemie.” His one blue eye danced. “If there is a
fight, I would like to see it. I would like to see those
Tonto whipped. But don’t expect me to stay with the
soldiers, Cheemie. That might make me trouble.
Come on, but we must be very careful, or the Tonto
will kill us, too.”</p>

<p>After having surveyed the soldiers’ trail the Tontos
had continued on beside it, and between it and the edge
of the basin. But Micky crossed the soldiers’ trail and
hurried away from it. He seemed much excited by the
prospect of a fight, for he set such a pace that Jimmie
half ran. Evidently he was going to circuit out and
back again, to cut the trail farther ahead.</p>

<p>Jimmie kept his ears sharp pricked for soldier
sounds—voices, or the creak of saddle-leathers, or the
tinkle of pack-mule bells; and also for the shooting of
guns: but all was silence. Twice Micky and he struck
the trail again. It wended right along, among the
trees, and it was getting fresher. Indeed, the soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
could not be far ahead, now. No Tonto trail had been
cut; therefore the Tontos were still on the other side
of the soldiers’ trail.</p>

<p>The sun had sunk toward some high purplish ridges
away yonder, bounding the basin in the west, and
evening was near. The third time that Micky led in, to
cut the trail, he and Jimmie got clear to the edge of the
great basin without coming to any trail at all. For
the last hundred yards they had crawled, with bunches
of weeds tied to their heads, lest the Tontos should be
in waiting, but nothing had happened.</p>

<p>The big pines extended to the edge of the basin,
and along the edge were large boulders, scattered among
the trees here. Some of them were the size of a hut.
They lay in twos and threes, as if dropped by a blast.</p>

<p>Micky, with Jimmie close behind, wormed from
the trees for two boulders that touched. They touched
at an angle, so that they left a space, within which
two boys might crouch, on the ground, and see out by
peeping through the cracks, or by standing up.</p>

<p>“We have come far enough, Cheemie,” whispered
Micky. “It is a good place to stay, till the Tonto
and the soldiers pass. And if they do not fight I am
going back to my White Mountains. But I want to see
the fight. Are you thirsty, Cheemie? You’ll have to
drink a stone.”</p>

<p>He picked up a round pebble and put it into his
mouth. Jimmie did the same. A pebble in the mouth
made the mouth wet.</p>

<p>“Listen!” bade Jimmie. “I hear tinkle!”</p>

<p>“Yes; pack-mules. The soldiers are coming. You<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
can go with them, Cheemie, but you must not say one
word about me. Promise.”</p>

<p>“All right, Micky.”</p>

<p>The bells of the pack-mules were yet a long way
off. Micky, with the weeds still bound on his head,
cautiously rose, to peer over the two boulders—and
down he dropped.</p>

<p>“S-s-s! Tonto!” he whispered.</p>

<p>He began to poke out his head, gradually, around
a corner of the rock on his side. Jimmie gently wriggled,
crawling flat, until he was under an over-hang
on his side, and might see straight before, with his head
just raised from the ground. Right up over the edge
of the mighty basin figures were popping, and scuttling
for the timber: a file of them, Apaches!</p>

<p>They crossed not more than thirty yards away.
They were naked of body and limbs, their hair was
black and long and straggly, they were daubed with
deer blood and mescal juice, they carried strung bows
and quivers, they were the fiercest, most hideous
Apaches that Jimmie had ever seen.</p>

<p>The low sun shone full against them, showing them
plainly. They scarcely glanced aside as they hurried;
and if they did chance to note Micky’s head or Jimmie’s
head, they thought them to be two motionless tufts of
weed, like other tufts growing here and there.</p>

<p>Tontos! Jimmie counted seventeen, all springing
out of the depths of the earth as suddenly as jacks-in-the-box,
darting across, and in among the pines.
Then there were two more, who dropped among the
rocks under the trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span></p>

<p>After the last had passed and vanished, Micky
kicked Jimmie’s leg, and Jimmie drew back to face
him behind the boulders. Micky’s blue eye fairly
sparkled; even his freckles glowed, he was so excited.
He certainly loved danger. He was not American
enough to say “Hurrah!” but he looked it!</p>

<p>“The Tonto are ready,” he whispered. “We’ll
see the fight. Good! Quick! The soldiers are
coming.”</p>

<p>He crawled around the boulders, craned and peered,
crept swiftly, with Jimmie in his tracks, to a better
place, and wormed his way until they both might lie
in a warm niche half filled with washed-in soil and
screened with brush. From here they could see much
better into the timber beyond the cross trail of the
Tontos.</p>

<p>Jimmie felt a wild desire to warn the soldiers of the
ambush by the Tontos; but the Tontos were cutting
him off and he had no time for making a circuit. No,
none at all. The soldiers were in sight—the head of
their column had appeared, riding on, up an aisle
through the towering pines, a short way back from the
edge of the basin.</p>

<p>The first, by themselves, were five, riding leisurely
almost knee to knee, and apparently enjoying the scenery.
Their voices might be heard, as they chatted.
One, a small, sun-dried man, wore an old slouch hat
and grayish flannel shirt and dark trousers and cowhide
boots. He was Tom Moore, a government packer.
Jimmie knew him—had seen him at Camp Grant and
in Tucson. Hah! And three were officers, in cavalry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
fatigue—there was Lieutenant John Bourke, of Camp
Grant! Yes, sir! And Lieutenant William Ross! And
another. But the man in the middle, on a mule, Jimmie
did not know at all.</p>

<p>If he was riding there he ought to be an officer, but
he seemed to be wearing a brown canvas suit, a sort of
brown canvas round-brimmed hat, and carried a shot-gun
across the pommel of his saddle, the muzzle of
course pointing ahead. Perhaps he was some sportsman
from the East, on a hunting trip, with the cavalry.</p>

<p>Micky lay perfectly still, intent to see with his one
eye what would happen, but Jimmie trembled. His
soldier friends were riding into an ambush and evidently
had no suspicion of danger. Neither did their
horses. The timber, with the sunshine streaming
through the long aisles, stretched fragrant and peaceful.
The air was so quiet that the riders’ voices, the
occasional blowing of the horses, the scuff of hoofs
and the creak of saddles, could be heard plainly.</p>

<p>The cavalry column itself was to be seen, behind,
a short distance, winding on among the trees, and the
tinkle of the pack bells sounded, again. Jimmie caught
his breath. Micky was tense, beside him. The advance
squad apparently had reached the Tontos—were
within short bow-shot, anyway. Why didn’t——?
Ah, look out!</p>

<p>“Twang! Whiz!” “Twang-twang! Whiz-whiz!”
“Twang-twang-twang!” And “Whiz! Thud!
Thud-thud!” The Tontos were whooping and screeching
and shooting; their daubed faces and flying hair
and naked bodies could be glimpsed gyrating among the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
trees; their arrows whizzed and glanced and hummed
and thudded, to the twanging of the bows. They were
mainly behind the advance squad, trying to stampede
the cavalry column. Up half-rose Jimmie, up half-rose
Micky, the better to see. <a href="#i_061">Had the first volley killed
anybody? Didn’t look so</a>, for not one of the squad
was in sight; the animals were rearing and snorting,
but every rider had instantly plunged from the saddle
and dived for a tree, gun in one hand and reins in the
other.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>That had been quick and smart work. Lieutenant
Bourke and Lieutenant Ross and Tom Moore were
no fools; and that sinewy man in the canvas suit was
no fool, either.</p>

<p>“Inju! Bueno! (Good! Good!)” chattered Micky,
in Apache and Spanish both. “Huh! Tonto run
already! Cowards!”</p>

<p>“Hurrah! There come the other soldiers!” babbled
Jimmie.</p>

<p>The carbines were banging, as the first troop began
to fight—officers shouted, the man in the canvas suit
jumped out, yelled orders and pointed, and leveled his
shot-gun—“Bang!” The first troop, dismounted to
the notes of a bugle, deployed on, firing, another troop
was spurring in at a gallop—and the Tontos were scampering
off through the timber.</p>

<p>Jimmie was just about to spring upright, glad, when
Micky nudged him hard, in warning. Not all the
Tontos had gone. The two who had dropped into ambush
among the rocks at the timber edge had been cut<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
off by the cavalry, and were now running back, and
dancing and dodging, their heads turned.</p>

<p>“Don’t shoot them!” shouted the canvas suit man,
in a loud voice. “We have them!”</p>

<p>He was running, too—and his officers—and the
foremost of the men—from tree to tree, after them,
to surround them at the edge of the basin. The two
Tontos had crouched, again, behind a large boulder.
Jimmie might have tossed a stone and struck them;
they were close in front of him and Micky, and fully
exposed, against the boulder. But the soldiers had
formed a half circle, hemming them in against the
basin’s edge. Up straightened the two Tontos, behind
their rock, drew their bows to the arrows’ heads, and
stood, at bay, aiming now here, now there, threatening
their enemies.</p>

<p>“Don’t shoot them!” the canvas suit man kept
shouting. “Take them alive.” And he called to the
Tontos: “Friends! Friends!”</p>

<p>However, the two Tontos would have none of <em>that</em>.
They stood braced, with bended bows, glaring from
tangled hair, as defiant and menacing as a coiled rattle-snake.
On a sudden—“Twang!”—they had loosed
their arrows, and with a single backward spring and
another bound had disappeared over the edge! Evidently
they preferred death to capture—they certainly
had killed themselves, for the basin looked to be a sheer
drop of over a thousand feet.</p>

<p>Out bolted Jimmie and ran, the better to see. Forward
ran the canvas suit man and his officers and the
soldiers. And there were the two Tontos, alive and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
running, themselves. They were leaping and bounding
like rabbits, from rock to rock and landing-place to
landing-place of the merest trail zigzagging them
almost straight up and down! that must have been the
trail which all the Tontos had climbed.</p>

<p>For a moment everybody was too astonished to
shoot. Then—“Bang!” The canvas suit man had
thrown his gun to his shoulder, lightning-quick, and
aimed and pulled trigger.</p>

<p>The second of the two Tontos leaped aside, one arm
fell limp, and was dyed red. But he did not slacken.
Now “Bang! Bang! Bang-bang!” The soldiers and
the officers also shot as fast as they could, so that even
the basin echoed. They were excited, and shooting
down-hill, the Tontos were leaping and dodging and
looked very small, not much larger than coyotes; and
as far as anybody might see, not a bullet touched them.</p>

<p>Pretty soon they had plunged into the brush and
scrub-oak chaparral almost at the bottom of the precipice;
they had got away.</p>

<p>Jimmie drew a long breath. In the excitement
he had forgotten all about himself. Now he came to,
and discovered that he was standing out here, alone,
on a curve of the basin rim; and that the soldiers, the
nearest only a few paces away, holding their smoking
carbines were surveying him keenly. Some had begun
to steal around, to head him off.</p>

<p>Naturally they took him for an Apache.</p>

<p>The canvas suit man had seen as quickly as any of
the soldiers.</p>

<p>“No cuidado, muchacho! Ven’ aqui! (Don’t be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
afraid, boy! Come here!),” he called, in Spanish, to
Jimmie. And added, in English, to the soldiers:
“Bring that boy in.”</p>

<p>Jimmie did not wait to be brought in. He raised his
hand in the “peace sign,” and ran forward, crying:</p>

<p>“I’m not Apache. I’m American. I’m Jimmie
Dunn, Lieutenant Bourke! Hello, Tom Moore! Don’t
you know me?”</p>

<small>JIMMIE REPORTS FOR DUTY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Well, for goodness’ sake!”</p>

<p>Bronzed Lieutenant Bourke stared: runty Packer
Tom Moore gaped amidst his wrinkles; everybody
stood stock-still, amazed. Jimmie’s shrill announcement,
as he ran in, created a sensation.</p>

<p>Now Lieutenant Bourke hastened to him; so did
Tom Moore; so did Lieutenant Ross: all the officers and
men within hearing pressed around him.</p>

<p>“By gracious, boy, we thought you were a bleached-out
Tonto!” exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?” demanded Lieutenant
Bourke. “Pete Kitchen said the Chiricahuas had
you.”</p>

<p>“They did,” answered Jimmie, so glad to speak
English again. He found the words a little stiff on his
tongue, but he had not forgotten. “I ran away.”</p>

<p>“Those were Tontos, weren’t they? How came
you among the Tontos?”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t among ’em. They didn’t have me.”</p>

<p>“Are you here alone?”</p>

<p>Huh! Jimmie looked around an instant; he was so
happy that he was a-tremble. He did not sight Micky;
the soldiers were covering the very spot where he and
Micky had been hiding, but Micky was not with them.
He had mysteriously vanished. Jimmie had promised
not to betray him, and must keep his word.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.” So far as he knew now, that was true.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<p>“How long have you been traveling?”</p>

<p>“Nearly a week, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Well if that ain’t the limit!” exploded weazened
Tom Moore.</p>

<p>“You’d better report to the general, Jimmie,” bade
Lieutenant Bourke kindly. “General George Crook—that
man in the canvas suit. He’s our department
commander now, so don’t omit to salute him. Come
along.”</p>

<p>Scanned by curious eyes, Jimmie followed First
Lieutenant John Bourke to where the man in the canvas
suit was standing expectant, his shot-gun at an order.</p>

<p>The lieutenant saluted, and Jimmie saluted. That
was regulations.</p>

<p>“This boy is Jimmie Dunn, sir,” reported the lieutenant.
“He was taken by the Chiricahuas about a
year ago, while herding sheep on the Kitchen ranch
south of Tucson. He says that he has run away from
them, and,” added the lieutenant, with a quizzical
laugh, “he doesn’t want to go back.”</p>

<p>Jimmie stood at attention, while General Crook eyed
him. This, then, was the new “comandante” of
whom Micky had spoken. He was a straight, square-shouldered,
active-looking man, as strong on his feet
as any Apache. Yes, he was of a tall, muscular build
like Geronimo. He was of light complexion, with
sandy hair and thin sandy moustache, and high forehead,
and from between two very keen, gray-blue eyes
a large sharp nose jutted down to a firm mouth set over
a longish, firm chin. He needed shaving. The hands
upon his shot-gun were brown and sinewy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p>Now he queried abruptly, military fashion but not
gruff; merely as though he required a short direct
answer.</p>

<p>“What band of Chiricahua?”</p>

<p>“Cochise’s band.”</p>

<p>“Where are they now?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir. They’re traveling around.”</p>

<p>“Where were they when you left them?”</p>

<p>“They were in the north part of the Chiricahua
Mountains, I think. They were moving to a new
camp, because of the soldiers.”</p>

<p>“Hah! Was Cochise there?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. He was out and so was Geronimo. It
was just the old men and the squaws. Most of the
chiefs were in Mexico, on raids.”</p>

<p>“Who is Geronimo?”</p>

<p>“He’s Go-yath-lay, the war chief.”</p>

<p>“How long ago did you run away?”</p>

<p>“Five days, I think.”</p>

<p>“How did you happen to get up here? Did the
Tonto have you?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. I was trying to go to Camp Apache.”</p>

<p>“You answer like a soldier, boy. Are you a soldier’s
son?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. My mother and father were killed by
the Apaches, but I lived with Joe Felmer. He’s post
blacksmith for Camp Grant.”</p>

<p>“Lieutenant Ross and Moore and I have seen him
there often, general,” put in Lieutenant Bourke. “He
calls Joe Felmer uncle, but they’re not relations, as I
understand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p>“No, sir; we’re not,” said Jimmie. “Joe is mighty
good to me, though.”</p>

<p>“Did the Chiricahua treat you well?” asked the
general.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; but I don’t like them.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” And General Crook slightly smiled.
When he smiled his face was kind and fatherly.</p>

<p>“Because they wanted to make me an Apache, so
I’d help them kill Americans and Mexicans and steal
cattle. They torture people. And they killed Lieutenant
Cushing, too!”</p>

<p>“How do you know that?” sharply queried the
general.</p>

<p>“They did, didn’t they, sir? I saw his shirt. Taza
was wearing it.”</p>

<p>“Hum!” mused the general. “Could you guide
us to the Cochise camp, do you think?”</p>

<p>“N-no, sir,” faltered Jimmie. “You see, they
have their own names for places, and sometimes I was
in Mexico and sometimes I was in Arizona, and I got
all mixed up.”</p>

<p>“I see,” admitted the general. “You say you were
trying to reach Camp Apache. Don’t you know that
this is a long way west of Camp Apache? How did
you happen to be off here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; I know it,” replied Jimmie. “The
Chiricahua might think I was starting for Camp
Apache, so I tried to fool them. Then I saw the Tonto
trail, and then I saw the soldiers’ trail, and I was
hurrying to catch you as soon as the Tonto did, when
the Tonto jumped out of the basin, and I couldn’t do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
anything but hide and watch. I knew the soldiers
would whip ’em, though. Did—did anybody get
killed?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the general grimly. “That will do,”
he continued. “We’ve been at Camp Apache, and
can’t take you back there; but we may be able to send
you down to Camp Grant. Turn him over to Mr.
Moore, if you please, lieutenant, and see that he’s outfitted
more like a white boy and less like an Indian.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.” Lieutenant Bourke saluted; Jimmie
rigidly saluted. “Come with me, Jimmie.” And they
looked up Tom Moore.</p>

<p>There were two troops of cavalry and twenty pack-mules.
Tom Moore was busy, just now, attending to
the pack-train; and having been left with him Jimmie
might gaze about and listen.</p>

<p>None of the soldiers had even been wounded, but
those Tontos certainly had shot hard. The general
and party were examining a pine-trunk into which a
Tonto arrow had buried itself clear to the feathers!
In several other tree trunks there were arrows that
could not be pulled out. As far as might be discovered,
no Tontos had been wounded, except the one shot
by the general. It had been a sharp skirmish, nevertheless.</p>

<p>Micky Free had disappeared. Not a trace of him
was noted. Jimmie loyally said not a word about him,
and did not see him again for some months.</p>

<p>“All right,” presently spoke Tom Moore. “Now,
boy, you can ride behind me, on my hoss, and I’ll fix you
out after we get to camp. Haven’t time here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p>For the sun was setting in a range of mountains
across the big basin; the basin itself was growing dark,
while the high plateau was still bathed in the last rays;
and the general had given the order to march and make
a camping-place.</p>

<p>With Jimmie behind his saddle, Tom rode in the
advance party. This was composed of the general,
and Lieutenant Bourke his aide, Captain Brent and
Lieutenant Ross and Guide Archie MacIntosh. Mr.
MacIntosh was a new man from the Hudson’s Bay
country of the Far North—a fine scout but not yet
acquainted with this part of Arizona. In fact, even
Tom Moore had never been through here. So Tom
was acting as pack-master and assistant guide, both.</p>

<p>At camp that evening Jimmie was awarded an old
flannel shirt and pair of cotton trousers. The shirt
belonged to Lieutenant Ross; the trousers belonged to
“Chileno John,” one of the packers. The suit didn’t
fit very well, but Jimmie now felt more like a white
boy again.</p>

<p>Because he was in charge of Tom Moore, his place
was with the packers. They were a merry set, around
their fires after supper: Charley Hopkins and old Jack
Long, of Tucson; and “Hank ’n Yank”—who were
Hank Hewitt and Yank Bartlett; and “Long” Jim
Cook (who had a brother “Short” Jim Cook); and
Jim O’Neill, and “Chileno John,” and José de Leon,
and Lauriano Gomez who sang Spanish songs; and
others. They looked rather rough and they talked
rather rough—but such stories they had to tell, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
their adventures in California and Arizona and Mexico,
and up in British Columbia!</p>

<p>The soldiers strolled over, to sit and listen and swap
yarns. The general and officers listened, too, now and
then, and laughed. Altogether it was a much more
pleasant camp than a Chiricahua rancheria.</p>

<p>According to soldiers’ and packers’ talk this General
George Crook had made a hit. He had suddenly
arrived, last June, in Tucson by stage from San Francisco,
to take command of the new Department of
Arizona. His regular rank was lieutenant-colonel in
the Twenty-third Infantry, but as he had been brevetted
or given honorary rank of major-general for gallant
service in the Civil War, he of course was called
“General.”</p>

<p>Up in the far Northwest, where he had commanded
the Department of the Columbia, he had done such good
work against the Shoshones or Snakes that the Government
had now sent him down to see what he could
do with the Apaches.</p>

<p>He had set right to work. “A powerful active
sort of man,” he was, declared Tom Moore. After
having questioned all the post commanders and many
scouts, about the trails and other conditions, he had
started out from Tucson with five companies of cavalry
and a company of scouts, both white and red, and a
great pack-train, to make a big circle of some six hundred
miles: east one hundred and ten miles to Camp
Bowie at Apache Pass in the Chiricahua Mountains,
thence north two hundred miles across the mountains
to Camp Apache and the White Mountain reservation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
thence west two hundred and fifty or three hundred
miles to Fort Whipple at the town of Prescott, which
was the department headquarters.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Bourke’s Troop F of the Third Cavalry
it was which had surprised the Geronimo and Nah-che
band and made them leave their meat; and there had
been other skirmishes. At Camp Apache the general
had talked to the White Mountain Apaches.</p>

<p>“That man,” asserted Tom Moore, “he cert’inly
knows Injun. He said he’d nothin’ against the ’Paches;
he wasn’t out to war on ’em, but to get ’em to live
peaceably. They could see for themselves that the
white people were crowdin’ into the country, and that
pretty soon there wouldn’t be enough game to live on.
So the ’Pache’d better decide to settle down and go
to farmin’ on the land that was given him. He’d be
protected from his enemies, and wouldn’t need to steal.
The ’Paches who came in peaceful wouldn’t be punished;
they’d be treated same as white people; but the
bad ones who hung out would make trouble for the
good ones, and he’d expect the good ’Paches to help
him run down the bad ’Paches. That sounded like
sense, and Pedro and the rest of ’em agreed.”</p>

<p>“He’s shorely got some pecul’ar idees,” commented
old Jack Long. “For one thing, he says an’
Injun’s as good as a white man an’ some white men
are wuss’n Injuns, ’cause they know better. But I
reckon when he says ‘peace’ he means peace, an’ when
he says ‘fight’ he means fight. He wanted mightily
to ketch those two Tonto an’ talk with ’em—an’ when
they threw arrers at him an’ skadoodled, blamed if he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
didn’t up an’ shoot ’em himself! Got the olive-branch
in one hand an’ sword in t’other, <em>he</em> has.”</p>

<p>However, with only these two companies of cavalry
and a small pack-train the general was now on his way
to Fort Whipple, there to wait and plan; for when
with all his force he had arrived at Camp Apache, he
had received dispatches from the War Department
directing him to quit until the Government Peace Commission
had tried.</p>

<p>This Peace Commission had been formed in 1867,
for the purpose of seeing that the Indians were being
honestly treated, and of persuading them to live upon
reservations. President U. S. Grant was much in
favor of such a scheme. The Indians of Arizona never
had been talked with, so the President was sending
a Mr. Vincent Colyer, a patriotic and large-hearted
New Yorker, to represent the Commission in the
Southwest.</p>

<p>“That thar peace plan may work with some o’ those
Eastern Injuns, but ’twon’t work with ’Paches,” grumbled
old Jack Long. “They got too much country
to travel ’round in, an’ war is meat an’ drink to ’em.
They ain’t been licked yet, an’ till they’re licked they’ll
think the whites are ’fraid of ’em. They won’t understand
civilian peace talk, by a stranger. Some big
white chief ought to do the talkin’. An’ now the
soldiers an’ settlers got to sit back an’ be perlite, so’s
not to stir up trouble, an’ Gin’ral Crook can’t make
his words good an’ go get the bad lots. ’Pache’ll see
’tain’t any use to stay on a reservation if he can have
more fun in the hills.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span></p>

<p>Jimmie rather believed, himself, that Mr. Colyer or
any stranger from the East, who was not used to
Indians, would have hard times “catching” the
Chiricahuas.</p>

<p>During the next few days General Crook proved
to be a most remarkable man indeed. At first sight,
nobody would take him for a general in the United
States army. He wore no uniform—just a plain canvas
suit; he rode a mule, and he preferred a shot-gun
to a rifle. He was not above talking to anybody, as he
chose. Only when you saw how straight and decisive
he was, would you suspect him to be a soldier and
an officer.</p>

<p>Nothing was too small for him to notice, and nothing
too hard for him to do. He could talk in the sign
language and he could read a trail. He could speak
Snake and Spanish and some Apache; and he knew
almost as much about Arizona as Tom Moore or Jack
Long did. He was up in the morning, even by two
o’clock, as soon as the cooks. All day, as he rode in
the advance, he constantly asked the names of trees and
bushes and flowers, and mountains and streams—and
he never forgot. He was a tremendous hunter, and
could stuff the beasts and birds that he killed, and he
had studied wild animals until he could tell many
curious things about them. He liked to explore by
himself, with gun and fishing-rod, and never was lost.
He drank only cold water—no tea or coffee. He could
do without drinking at all, and without eating, either.
In fact, Tom Moore and Archie MacIntosh agreed, he
could “out-Injun the Injuns”!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<p>The pack-train was his particular hobby.</p>

<p>“He fetched a lot o’ notions down from Idyho an’
Californy,” explained old Jack, with wag of head; “an’
by jinks, he began to tear things loose as soon as he
struck Tooson. Nothin’s too good for the pack-train.
Consequence is, now we’ve got critters an’ men who’ll
go anywhar a dog’ll go, an’ be fresh for an’ arly start
next mornin’. He’s sort o’ pack-train daddy, I reckon.”</p>

<p>Jimmie did not ride clear through to Fort Whipple
at Prescott. At Camp Verde, the post fifty miles this
side of Whipple, the general sent off dispatches for
some of the posts south, and told Jimmie that this was
a good chance to reach Camp Grant, where he belonged.</p>

<p>“But if you do fight the Apaches, can I help?”
ventured Jimmie.</p>

<p>He loved the bronzed, lean, untiring, wise General
Crook, so brief of speech, so kind in manner, so fatherly
and yet so soldierly; who quickly learned whatever he
didn’t happen to know already, and who somehow got
things done without any loud orders.</p>

<p>“I didn’t come in here to fight them,” smiled the
general. “I came in to make peace. But those who
won’t make peace and keep it, I’ll fight very hard—they
may depend on that also. I promised the White
Mountain Apaches that I’d protect the good Indians
and punish the bad ones; and the only way to control
Indians is to do exactly what you promise to do. Now
we’ll all have to wait until Mr. Colyer of the Peace
Commission has tried. He’ll give them an opportunity
to gather upon reservations and learn to support
themselves without murdering and stealing. A great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
deal of the fighting between the Indians and the whites
has been unnecessary, because there are white men
who don’t believe in good Indians. You go to your
friends at Camp Grant. Learn all you can about pack-mules
and soldier duties, too, and don’t forget Apache.
I haven’t any doubt that some day you can help the
Government very much.”</p>

<p>When at last Jimmie was delivered at Camp Grant,
and set out for Joe Felmer’s little ranch, above, to surprise
Joe, he met him coming in, mule back. As a
result, Joe opened his whiskered mouth widely, and
almost fell off his mule: for here was Jimmie Dunn,
who had been captured by the Apaches in mid-summer
of 1870, and now it was the close of August, 1871.</p>

<p>“Hello, black-beard white man,” greeted Jimmie, in
his best Apache.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VI">VI<br />
<small>THE PEACE COMMISSION TRIES</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Wall, ’xpec’ you want to hear all the news yourself,”
proposed “Uncle” Joe, that evening, at the
ranch, after Jimmie had told his own story in every
detail.</p>

<p>“Yes, if you please,” answered Jimmie.</p>

<p>“Wall,” mused Joe Felmer, stroking his shaggy
full beard, “lemme see. ‘Six-toed’ Hutton’s been
kicked in the jaw by a mule, an’ he’s like to go under.
The kick busted his heart, same time it busted his jaw,
’cause he ought to’ve known better than to get in the
way.”</p>

<p>“Six-toed” Hutton’s real name was Oscar Hutton.
He had six toes on either foot, and was one of the
bravest scouts at Camp Grant. To be killed by a mule
kick did indeed seem an untimely end for a scout.</p>

<p>“’Paches have been awful bad all ’long the line,”
continued Joe. “Chiricahuas an’ Tontos an’ Pinals
been raidin’ the stage road out o’ Tucson, both ways.
Forty-seven whites an’ Mexicans have been killed down
thar’bouts, an’ ten thousand dollars’ wuth o’ property
burned or stolen. Up ’round Prescott the Hualpais an’
Apache-Mohaves have corraled the mail rider an’ run
ranchers an’ miners off. An’ a passel o’ blamed rascals
lit out with an old mule from my very pasture—three of
’em at once on her back, in broad day!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<p>The recollection of this evidently made “Uncle”
Joe very angry again. He paused to mumble.</p>

<p>“Thar’s a band o’ Es-kim-en-zin’s Pinals an’ Arivaipas
farmin’ on the creek ’bout a mile from Grant,”
he resumed. “Gathered thar ag’in after that massacre
last spring, when those whites an’ Mexicans an’ Papagos
from Tucson way came up an’ wiped out ’most
their women an’ old men an’ stole their children.
Yessir, killed over seventy squaws an’ only eight bucks,
some of ’em while asleep, an’ carried off thirty children.
Sold ’em ’mongst the Mexicans an’ Papagos, they did.
Now I hear tell that the Government’s sendin’ what it
calls a ‘peace commissioner,’ from New Yawk, to
fetch in other ’Paches an’ feed ’em an’ treat ’em nice.
Wall, reckon he’ll have his hands full.”</p>

<p>Although Joe and others, soldiers and civilians both,
at Camp Grant, insisted that there could be no good
excuse for attacking Indians who had surrendered
themselves, the Tucson papers and people declared that
these very Pinals and Arivaipas had recently been
murdering Americans and Mexicans, and stealing stock,
and deserved Indian punishment instead of white protection.
It would teach the Apaches a lesson.</p>

<p>Of course, when one’s father and mother and
brothers and sisters have been tortured and killed only
because they were white, it is hard to feel at all kindly
toward the race that did it. Jimmie knew how that
was. White persons’ clothing—the clothing of the
very ones who had been murdered—was found in the
Pinal and Arivaipa camp. Still, for the white people
to act like Indians, set a bad example, if the Indians<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
were to be shown that the white way of living was the
better way.</p>

<p>The Camp Grant massacre aroused a great cry in
the East. The East sided with the Apaches. But
when he had arrived, Commissioner Colyer seemed to
be going about with very odd notions. He was reported
as thinking that the Apaches were only a poor
ignorant race, who had been robbed of their lands
and forced into war by the whites, and that they ought
to be met with kindness alone. Then they would be
peaceable. The Tucson <cite>Citizen</cite> asserted that he advised
the Arizona people to avoid trouble by getting
out of the Indians’ way. And the <cite>Citizen</cite> and the Prescott
<cite>Miner</cite> published hot, sarcastic articles about him
and the Peace Policy. The Apaches were being referred
to as “Colyer’s babes” and “Colyer’s pets.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” growled Joe. “Thinks the Chiricahuas
an’ Tontos don’t know any better’n to hang
folks up by their heels over a slow fire, does he? An’
that we ought to call off the troops an’ get off our
ranches, so we won’t be irritatin’ the Injuns? Then
they’d come in of themselves, to be civilized! Jest why
the ’Paches who can live by fightin’ an’ stealin’ as they
please will want to live by ploughin’, I’d like to hear.
This is part o’ the United States, an’ the white people
are jest as much entitled to protection as the ’Paches
are.”</p>

<p>Camp Grant was a four- or five-company post
located here in a desert basin where the valley of the
Arivaipa Creek, from the east, and of the San Pedro
River, from the south, joined. The San Pedro was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
supposed to flow on north, for a few miles, to the
Gila River; but it and the Arivaipa were only dry sand-beds
during the greater part of the year.</p>

<p>Camp Grant was not a pretty place; it was only a
hollow square of clay or log huts and ragged tents,
shaded in front by brush porches or <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ramadas</i>.</p>

<p>Against it beat the sand-storms in the spring and
the blazing sun throughout nine months of the year—temperature,
one hundred and twenty in the shade!
The giant cactuses, instead of trees, were many and
extra large—and so were the rattle-snakes, scorpions
and centipedes. And the Apache had always been
extra bold.</p>

<p>One never might foresee what was about to occur,
at Camp Grant. On some days it would be perfectly
quiet, with only the sentries walking their hot beats,
and the tame Indians squatting out of the sun; and
again there would be a sudden running to and fro,
and away would trot the cavalry, to rescue (if possible)
a wagon train, and pursue the hostiles.</p>

<p>In a few days, at best, but likely enough not until
after a week or more, back the troopers would come,
maybe with wounded, maybe with prisoners, but in any
case all fagged out, both men and horses.</p>

<p>Joe Felmer’s little ranch lay three miles south,
up the San Pedro. As Joe was post blacksmith, and
also sold ranch stuff to the quartermaster, Jimmie felt
as though he belonged to the post, himself. He knew
all the officers, and old Sergeants Warfield and John
Mott, and others of the men; and “Six-toed,” and
Antonio Besias the former Mexican captive of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
Apaches, and Concepcion Equierre the half-Apache
interpreter, and old Santos the short-legged Arivaipa
ex-chief who was Chief Es-kim-en-zin’s father-in-law;
and many more.</p>

<p>When he had left, last year, Grant had been occupied
by some of the First and the Third Cavalry; but
they had been transferred, Lieutenant Cushing’s and
Lieutenant Bourke’s Troop K of the Third had been
sent down to Camp Lowell near Tucson, and now the
Fifth Cavalry was here.</p>

<p>It was in October when Commissioner Colyer, on
his rounds, appeared at Camp Grant. Jimmie was
lucky enough to drive down there, with Joe and a
wagon-load of pumpkins, just in time to be present
at some of the “doings.”</p>

<p>Mr. Colyer had arrived in a six-mule army ambulance
(a black, covered spring wagon with high driver’s
seat, and two bench-like seats inside, facing each other),
escorted by a squad of cavalry from Fort Whipple,
under Lieutenant Ross.</p>

<p>He was a square-set, benevolent-looking gentleman,
in dusty black broadcloth, and white shirt and broad
black hat. Attended by Colonel F. W. Crittenden, the
post commander, and by other officers, he had been
talking, through Concepcion the interpreter, to the tame
Apaches at the post, and he was about to go out to
Chief Es-kim-en-zin’s rancheria, where the surrendered
Pinals and Arivaipas were farming.</p>

<p>“They are the same people who were so barbarously
attacked last spring, I understand,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Lieutenant Royal Whitman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<p>“You were in charge of the post then, were you
not?”</p>

<p>“I was. But before I could reach their camp the
deed had been done. I think you will see by my report
upon the matter, to the Department, how I feel about
it. It was a thorough outrage, and the members of the
attacking party ought to be arrested, tried and
punished.”</p>

<p>“Quite true,” uttered Mr. Colyer. “A shocking
state of affairs exists through the whole Territory. All
the Indians with whom I have talked declare that they
would gladly gather upon reservations, accept the Government’s
aid, and live at peace with mankind, if the
soldiery and white citizens would only cease hunting
them down. Some of the bands are so frightened and
timid that they won’t confer even with me, their friend.
I’ve tried in vain to meet Chief Cochise, of the Chiricahuas.
You can see, my brothers,” he continued, addressing
the group of soldiers and scouts and tame
Apaches, “what an injustice has been done these simple
savages. Our duty is not to punish them for defending
their homes, but to gain their good-will by patience
and kindness, until they are won to the benefits of
civilization. That is why the President and the Society
of Friends have delegated me to visit among you, and
bring this bad feeling between the white men and the
red men to an end.”</p>

<p>“‘Simple savages,’ are they?” afterwards commented
Joe. “If thar’s anybody smarter’n an Apache
in sizin’ things up, I’ve yet to find him. At present
this hyar Quaker strikes me as bein’ ’bout the simplest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
pusson in Arizony. The ’Paches can understand
straight talk, like that Gen’ral Crook gave ’em, an’
they can understand war; but they don’t understand
coaxin’. When you coax a ’Pache he laughs in his
insides an’ reckons he’ll do as he pleases as long as
he can. Once you coax him, then he thinks you’re
’fraid of him, ’cause that’s Injun way.”</p>

<p>Mr. Colyer was driven out to the Chief Es-kim-en-zin
camp, where he talked with old Santos and the
chief, and others of the Pinals and Arivaipas. He
informed them that the Great White Father at Washington
would see to it that they were no longer ill-treated
by the white men. All the Apaches might come
in and live on the lands that the Government was giving
them. They should have plenty to eat, and the white
men who interfered should be punished.</p>

<p>When he returned to the post he acted much satisfied.
He arranged to have a regular reservation set
off, and said that an agent and teacher would be appointed,
by the Society of Friends. Soon he left, with
his escort, to continue his tour.</p>

<p>While nobody might doubt that Mr. Colyer was a
very good and honest man, nobody put much faith
in his methods. After having fought and raided all
summer, many of the wild Apaches would be only too
willing to be fed and protected upon the reservations,
all winter.</p>

<p>Now the Indians of Arizona seemed to be provided
for—except that Commissioner Colyer had not been
able to find any Chiricahuas. He had sent word to
them, but they had hidden from him. And when in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
western New Mexico he had stopped at the Cañada
Alamosa, or Cottonwood Canyon, where Chief Victorio’s
friendly Mimbres and Warm Spring Apaches
were living, the most of them had run from his soldier
escort. They liked their Cottonwood Canyon, and
feared that they were to be removed.</p>

<small>JIMMIE TAKES A LESSON</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Micky Free!”</p>

<p>Jimmie almost shouted it, he was so astonished.
He was again at the post, on an errand for Joe Felmer,
after Commissioner Colyer had been gone about a
week; and who should come trotting across the hot
gravelly parade ground but Micky Free himself, in
single file with two strange Indians!</p>

<p>Micky’s one quick eye sighted Jimmie, standing
agape, and he fell out of line and pattered over,
grinning.</p>

<p>“How do you do, Boy-who-sleeps?” he said, in
Apache.</p>

<p>“How do you do, Red-head?” answered Jimmie.
“I am glad to see you.”</p>

<p>Micky wore a loose, whitish cotton shirt with its
tails outside ragged cotton trousers, and on his feet
Apache moccasins. A white cloth band was around
his red head, his one blue eye beamed alertly, and his
freckled face was streaked with perspiration and dust.
All that he carried was an Apache fiddle made from
a bent rib of a yucca, strung with deer sinews.</p>

<p>The two Indians with him were stripped to breech-clout
aprons, and moccasins, and red flannel head-bands;
one of them had rawhide shield and long lance,
the other, bow and quiver. They had continued on and
now had been stopped before the adjutant’s office by
the orderly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p>“Let us sit down and talk, Cheemie,” laughed
Micky.</p>

<p>So he and Jimmie squatted.</p>

<p>“What are you doing, Micky?”</p>

<p>“I have come over from Camp Apache with two
White Mountain runners. They bring messages from
that fort to this one. We came through in one day
and two nights. It is more than one hundred miles.
Have you heard the news, Cheemie?”</p>

<p>“What news, Micky?”</p>

<p>“Cochise says he wants peace. He has gone on
the Ojo Caliente (Warm Spring) place, in the Cañada
Alamosa, where Chief Victorio is.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?” exclaimed Jimmie. This
was great news.</p>

<p>“I got it from Maria Jilda, the Mexican who was
captured when you were captured. He came up to
Camp Apache from the Apache Pass where Camp
Bowie is. He escaped from the Chiricahua, and now
he is an interpreter at Camp Bowie. Yes, Cheemie;
Cochise and Geronimo and all that band have gone to
live with their brothers the Warm Springs and the
Mimbreños at the Cañada Alamosa on the Rio Grande
River in New Mexico. But,” added Micky, wisely,
“they will not stay.”</p>

<p>“Don’t they want peace?” queried Jimmie. “Did
they listen to the words of the white peace man?”</p>

<p>“That white peace man in the black clothes?”
demanded Micky scornfully. “No. The Apaches
laugh at that white peace man. It is easy to lie to
him. The wild Apache think he promises so much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
because the Americans are afraid of them. The
Cochise people are hungry and winter is near and the
soldiers have been fighting them hard. They hear that
Victorio is being fed and has plenty of clothes and
guns. They can rest there until they are ready to
take the trail again. What are you doing, Cheemie?
Do you like the new American general? I saw him
shoot that Tonto. He is a good shot. Afterwards
I found the Tonto. He was dead. Then I went to the
White Mountains, at Camp Apache.”</p>

<p>“I am living with Joe Felmer, on his ranch. He
is a scout, and he works at the post, too,” informed
Jimmie. “The general sent me home, but he told me
to learn all the soldier ways I could, and not to forget
Apache talk. If I’m not old enough to be a scout, I
can help with the pack-trains.”</p>

<p>“I shall be a scout,” nodded Micky. “That is why
I have come out with the runners: to learn the country.
He is a great general, that man Crook. Chief Pedro
and old Miguel liked his talk. It is true that if some
of the Apaches stay bad, the good Apaches will suffer by
it. They will be watched closely and cannot do things
they would do if all the Apaches were trusted. So
Chief Pedro and the White Mountains will help the
new general who talks straight. It is this way,
Cheemie—I have heard Pedro and old Miguel and
Pi-to-ne and all, say so: As long as there are any
wild Chiricahua and Tonto, there will be trouble between
the red men and the white men, in Arizona.
We must kill the bad Apaches. Then the good
Apaches can live at peace and get rich. In the spring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
the new general must begin to fight, because by then
the Chiricahua will be rested up.”</p>

<p>The two Apache runners or dispatch-bearers came
back from the adjutant’s office. Their names, as told
by Micky, were Alchisé (Alchisay) and Nah-kay-do-klunni.
They both were Sierra Blanca—White Mountain
Apaches. They and Micky were taken by Antonio
Besias the interpreter to be given coffee and bread;
and as there was nothing more to be said, Jimmie went
about his own business. He knew that he would see
Micky Free again, somewhere. Micky was that kind.</p>

<p>Although Chief Cochise and War-Captain Geronimo
had moved with their band of Chiricahuas upon
the Cottonwood Canyon reservation near Fort Craig
in southwestern New Mexico, and Commissioner Colyer
had been so confident that all <em>his</em> Indians were about
to gather upon <em>their</em> reservations, the white people of
Arizona had no faith in this peace policy.</p>

<p>Almost every copy of the Tucson <cite>Citizen</cite> and the
Prescott <cite>Miner</cite> received by Joe Felmer or at Camp
Grant contained accounts of Apache attacks upon settlers
and miners and soldiers, by the Tontos and the
Apache-Mohaves, and the Chiricahuas raiding up from
Mexico.</p>

<p>The <cite>Miner</cite> published a list of three hundred Americans
and Mexicans who had been killed by the Apaches
from 1864 to the present time, October 14, 1871.</p>

<p>Toward the end of November the worst news yet,
arrived. A band of “Colyer’s babes,” thought to be
Apache-Mohaves, had attacked the stage near Wickenburg,
south of Prescott, and murdered the driver and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
five passengers. Three of these passengers were members
of the Government surveying expedition which,
under Lieutenant George Wheeler, of the U. S. Engineers,
had been exploring through Nevada and Arizona,
getting facts upon the mines and the country.
The name of one was Fred Loring—a well-educated,
especially fine young surveyor, from Washington.</p>

<p>This attack, said the papers, ought to convince
the Government that the Apaches of Arizona were
far from “civilized.” These very Indians had been
living “peaceably” upon one of Commissioner Colyer’s
tracts, where they were protected.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Wheeler and his main party commanded
by Lieutenant David A. Lyle of the Second Artillery,
with an escort of the Third Cavalry (Company I), supplied
by the Department of California, rode into Camp
Grant only a few days after the word of the Wickenburg
Massacre had been received.</p>

<p>They were on their way from Camp Apache to
Tucson; had been exploring since the middle of May,
and were pretty well worn out. They had found many
of the Indians met to be rude and insolent, but——</p>

<p>“No, they never attacked us,” said Lieutenant Lyle.
“And now, to think that they’ve killed poor Loring,
when he was all through and was going home! He
had his hair cut very short, on his road out, and laughed
when he claimed that the Apaches would never be able
to take <em>his</em> scalp.”</p>

<p>“One drop of that fine young man’s blood was
worth more to the United States than the whole Apache
race is,” declared Lieutenant Wheeler. “In my opinion,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
the peace policy of forbidding a military campaign
that shall drive the Apaches in upon the reservations is
encouraging them to commit such outrages. The Indian
question in Arizona will never be settled until the
campaigns of an energetic officer shall thoroughly whip
and subdue them.”</p>

<p>“And Crook’s that man,” asserted Chief Packer
Tom Moore, who was over from Fort Whipple, on a
trip around to inspect pack-train outfits. “We’ve had
other gen’rals in Arizony. Some of ’em did too much—took
ev’ry scalp they could ketch. Some of ’em did too
little—reg’lar coffee-coolers. But this Gen’ral Crook,
gentlemen, he’s goin’ to know for himself whether a
’Pache’s good or bad. The good ones he’ll treat square,
and the bad ones he’ll trail down till he has their
tongues hangin’ out. Now he’s just lyin’ low, till
the Government’s got plumb sick o’ these ‘Colyer’s
babes,’ and he has orders. If I don’t miss my guess,
next spring the Arizony hills’ll be full o’ soldiers and
pack-trains, and tame ’Paches fightin’ wild ’Paches, and
Crook bossin’ us all from the saddle.”</p>

<p>Tom Moore and others from Fort Whipple brought
word that General Crook kept very active. He seemed
to have no idea of resting. He was constantly traveling,
by mule and buck-board wagon, over the roads
and trails of northern Arizona, learning them as he
had learned the trails of southern Arizona. Usually
he traveled with only Lieutenant Bourke, who was his
aide-de-camp, and a cook and a packer, for he did not
wish to use officers and men who should be ready for
scouting expeditions. He issued orders that the pack-train<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
outfits should be prepared at top notch. It was
plain to be seen that he expected to go upon a hard campaign
as soon as the Peace Policy had been tried and
had failed.</p>

<p>Jimmie decided that his best chance of taking the
trail with this active General Crook lay with the pack-trains;
even a boy might be useful in the pack-trains;
he could catch mules and pull on ropes and help the cook—and
if he spoke Apache, like Jimmie did, and knew
lots of Apache tricks, he might be valuable as an interpreter,
sometimes. Besides, Joe Felmer was a scout
and a horse-shoer both, and he surely would be ordered
out. Jimmie intended not to be left at home.</p>

<p>Luckily, he had plenty of opportunity this fall and
winter to learn pack-train wrinkles. For the practice
that it gave the men, as well as because it was the better
method, the general distributed the supplies to all the
posts by means of pack-mules.</p>

<p>Before he had assumed command, the supplies out
of Tucson and Prescott had been hauled largely by
wagons in charge of “bull whackers” and “mule
skinners,” and operated by civilian contractors, who
made freighting their business. Of course, pack-mules
had been necessary, too, with scouting columns and
between out-of-the-way posts; and the miners, and the
Mexican merchants and traders from Sonora of
Mexico, employed pack-mules.</p>

<p>But in his campaigns against the Indians, in Idaho
and Oregon and Northern California, the general had
depended entirely upon pack-mule trains, which kept
right up with the marches, no matter how rough the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
country, and were always on hand. According to the
say of old Jack Long, “he had got pack-mule wise.” He
had persuaded the War Department to buy three full
pack-trains from their civilian owners who had hired
them out to the Government; and these he had brought
to Arizona with him.</p>

<p>“He’s the daddy o’ the army mule, I reckon,”
again declared Jack. “Yes, siree! Those thar mules
ain’t nary sore-backed Sonora rats, an’ they ain’t
bags o’ bones so high up you have to use a ladder to
put a pack on with. They’re picked stock; an’ every
other mule’s got to measure up to same standard.
Gosh durn it, I b’lieve the gin’ral thinks as much of
his mules as he does of his men! He looks as close
arter glanders as he does arter measles!”</p>

<p>However, the general looked after the men pretty
close, too. The packers themselves had to measure up
to standard. Those who were drunken, or lazy, or
cruel to the mules, were discharged, and better men
enlisted. Henceforward the pack-train service was to
be known as “Pack Transportation, Q. M. D. (Quartermaster’s
Department), U. S. Army,” and to belong
to it would be an honor.</p>

<p>Yes, a responsibility, also; for as old Jack explained:
“When you get up in the mountings ’mongst
the ’Paches, an’ you’re out o’ ammunition an’ the pack-train’s
got busted somewhars in the next county, then
what’s your scalp wuth? Nothin’!”</p>

<p>Jimmie might think himself lucky in having old
Jack Long at Camp Grant, to give him pointers. Joe
Felmer was a scout and rancher; he did not claim to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
an expert mule packer. But old Jack had been a
Forty-niner in California, and had mined and packed
all through California and Oregon and Idaho and
Nevada and Arizona. So he knew a great deal.</p>

<p>Jack had had two wives, one a Modoc squaw and
one a white woman; and once he had “struck it rich,”
in California, and had been almost a millionaire until
he had spent his money. Lately he had been living in
Tucson, freighting and prospecting. There he had
“j’ined Gin’ral Crook ag’in the ’Paches.”</p>

<p>Now Chief Packer Tom Moore had appointed him
to be a pack-master. The chief packer had charge
of all the pack-trains, and each pack-train was in
charge of its pack-master.</p>

<p>“Want to j’ine the pack trains, do ye?” queried
old Jack, of Jimmie. “Wall, if you’re goin’ to l’arn,
you oughter l’arn right, an’ some day mebbe you’ll
be in the Fust-class Packer ratin’. Mebbe you’ll get
to be as big a man as I am. ’Tain’t all in throwin’
the diamond; anybody can l’arn to throw the diamond
hitch. But you got to know the why an’ wharfore
o’ things. Come along to the corral an’ I’ll show ye.”</p>

<p>So Jimmie gladly followed Jack to the post mule-corral.</p>

<p>“Hey, thar, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">amigo</i> (friend)!” summoned old Jack,
to Chileno John, who was at work among the mules.
“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Ven’ aqui</i> (Come here). Fetch out one o’ yore
bell sharps. Hyar’s a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">muchacho</i> (boy) who wants to
l’arn to be an <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">arriero</i> (muleteer).”</p>

<p>Smiling broadly, swarthy Chileno John (who was
supposed to have worked in the mines of Chile) led<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
aside a sedate, round-bellied, mouse-colored mule, and
lugged the pack material for her into position.</p>

<p>“That thar,” said Jack, “is a bell sharp. If you
don’t know what a bell sharp is, I’ll tell ye. A bell
sharp is a pack-mule that’s been eddicated into mule
sense, so she keeps her place in line, an’ doesn’t stray
on herd, an’ comes in to her own feed canvas at feedin’
time. When she ain’t a ‘bell sharp’ she’s a pesky
‘shave-tail.’ As long as a mule hasn’t got sense an’ is
alluz rampagin’ an’ makin’ trouble we jest natter’ly
roach her mane an’ keep her tail trimmed to about six
ha’rs on the end so’s to pick her out of a bunch at
fust sight. Same way,” grumbled old Jack, “’mongst
these hyar army officers. That thar sprig young
Left’nant Stewart, fresh out o’ West Point, who
doesn’t know any better yet’n to climb a cactus tree, he’s
a ‘shave tail’; but old Cap Tommy Byrne, up ’mongst
the Hualpais near the Canyon, he’s a sure ’nough ‘bell
sharp’ who knows when to come in to his feed.”</p>

<p>Jimmie had not seen Captain Thomas Byrne, a
grizzled Civil War veteran who, reports stated, was
regarded as a “father” by the Hualpai Indians on the
Beale Springs reservation near the Grand Canyon.
But he felt pretty well acquainted with Second Lieutenant
Reid T. Stewart, the slim-waisted, boyish, eager
young officer who had graduated from the Military
Academy only last June and had been assigned to the
Fifth Cavalry in Arizona. He was stationed down at
Camp Lowell, Tucson, and Jimmie had got acquainted
with him there and here at Grant, also. He might be
a “shave tail,” yet, according to Jack, but he was much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
more pleasant than some of those crusty old “bell
sharps.”</p>

<p>“What’s General Crook, then?” queried Jimmie,
to get Jack’s opinion.</p>

<p>“The gin’ral. See hyar, me son,” reproved Jack
severely: “no levity. The gin’ral’s the old bell hoss
o’ the hull outfit. Wall,” continued Jack, “fust, one
of us blinds the critter with a bandage o’ sackin’ or
with one o’ those leather contraptions the gin’ral’s
interduced, so she’ll stand. Then havin’ got all the
riggin’ to hand, we lay on this sweat-cloth, for which
proper name is <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">suadera</i>, an’ a saddle-blanket or two
for more paddin’, ’less we have a reg’lar <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">corona</i>, the
same bein’ the blankets an’ the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">suadera</i> stitched together.
Then atop that we fold the bed blanket that
we got to sleep under at camp. Then we h’ist on the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">aparejo</i>—this-a-way, easy—an’ settle it, an’ pass the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">grupera</i> back.”</p>

<p>The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">aparejo</i> (ah-pah-ray-ho) was the pack-saddle—a
long, broad mattress of canvas stuffed with hay,
and stiffened with ribs of willow stems running up and
down, in either half. It was broken in the middle, so
that it would fit over the mule’s back.</p>

<p>The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">grupera</i> (gru-pay-rah) was the crupper—a
broad canvas and leather band that extended in a loop
around the mule’s haunches under her tail, so that the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">aparejo</i> could not slip forward.</p>

<p>“Then we lay the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">aparejo cincha</i> so to hang acrost
the middle, pass the ring end under her belly, connect
up with the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">latigo</i> strap and all together draw tighter’n
sin so’s to hold the aparejo in place.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span></p>

<p>The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">aparejo cincha</i> was another canvas band, like
a woven saddle-cinch. It was long enough to reach
across under the mule’s belly. One end terminated in
a ring and the other end in a leather strap, the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">latigo</i>;
and by connecting the ring and strap the cincha was
drawn tight.</p>

<p>“You have omitted to explain this, Señor Jack,”
reminded Chileno John, resting a sinewy brown hand
upon the pack-saddle or aparejo; and he lifted the flap
that hung down on either side.</p>

<p>“That thar soldier hammer?” grunted Jack.
“Wall, me son, every aparejo has a duck kivver
attached to its middle, so’s to protect it from bein’
cut by the ropes—an’ from weather, too. It’s got a
wooden brace sewed in leather ’crost each end, yuh
understan’, to stiffen it whar the cincha lays, so’s it
won’t wrinkle ag’in the mule’s hide.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Sobre-en-jalmas</i> is the correct name, muchacho,”
said Chileno John, to Jimmie, with some dignity—for
Chileno John took great pride in the Spanish language.
“It is a very old name, descended to us from
the ancient Moors of Spain. Sobre-en-jalmas—cover
for harness. The first two words are Spanish, and the
last word is Arabian. But these Americanos——!”
And Chileno John shrugged his shoulders. “They do
not know.”</p>

<p>“Wall, ‘soldier hammer,’ ‘sovrin hammer,’ or
‘Sullivan hammer,’ it’s all the same,” grunted old
Jack. “Plain ‘aparejo cover’ is good enough.” And
thus he disposed of the historic sobre-en-jalmas, which,
pronounced rapidly sobr’-’n-halma did indeed sound<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
like some kind of a ‘hammer.’ “After the pack
saddle, ’long with its sovrin hammer, is cinched on,
then we h’ist on the packs an’ sling ’em an’ fasten ’em
with the diamond hitch,” he resumed. “But as we
haven’t got nary packs, the fust lesson stops right hyar,
me son. Now you remember what I’m tellin’ you,
l’arn mules and pack-ways, an’ jump when you’re spoken
to, so you won’t be a drag tail.”</p>

<p>“What’s a ‘drag tail,’ Jack?”</p>

<p>“A drag tail, me son, is wuss’n a shave tail. A
drag tail is a durned lazy mule who’s alluz hangin’ back
on the trail, an’ a no-’count packer who’s alluz late
on his job. Savvy?”</p>

<small>THE ONE-ARMED GENERAL TRIES</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Hey! Cochise is out again!”</p>

<p>It was a spring day of this next year, 1872, and in
the ranch yard on the Joe Felmer place Jimmie and
his assistant, little Francisco Vasquez, were practicing
pack-train.</p>

<p>Jimmie was the pack-master, little Francisco (a
Mexican boy) was arriero or muleteer; the train was
composed of Shosh (Bear), a big black shepherd dog,
Pete, a yellow hound dog, and Two-bits, just dog.</p>

<p>Shosh already had learned to carry a pack and pack-rigging,
dog size. He was a real “bell sharp.” Two-bits
was still an unruly “shave tail,” and the yellow
Pete was so lazy that he ranked as only a “drag tail.”
But they furnished good practice for Jimmie.</p>

<p>Now Joe, returning from a trip down to Tucson,
brought startling news. Cochise was “out” again!
Even little Francisco looked alarmed.</p>

<p>“Are all the Chiricahua out, Joe?”</p>

<p>“Cochise an’ Geronimo an’ nigh two hundred
more of ’em. That pesky Colyer man on his way back
to the States got the Government to move all the
’Paches from whar they were comf’table in the Warm
Spring country to another part o’ the New Mexico
country called the Tularosa; an’, by jinks, Cochise said
he wouldn’t go—an’ he didn’t go! He took his Chiricahua
an’ lit out for his old stampin’-ground in Arizony.
So the word’s been passed to watch for trouble.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<p>Joe stalked on, muttering, to carry some purchases
into the house. Jimmie the pack-master and little
Francisco the arriero dismissed their pack-train and
quit for the day. The knowledge that Cochise and
Geronimo and their shifty Chiricahuas had left the
Cañada Alamosa reservation, where they had been
staying with Chief Victorio’s Warm Spring band, and
had joined the fighting Chiricahuas who had stayed
“wild,” cast a shadow upon foolery.</p>

<p>“Will the great General Crook march against them
now?” asked Francisco, his black eyes round and large.</p>

<p>“Who knows?” responded Jimmie, in Spanish.
“There’s a new peace man coming from Washington.
Then if the Chiricahua will not listen to peace, they
will hear war. Bueno!”</p>

<p>“Bueno (Good)!” piped Francisco. “Will you
take me, Jeem?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, chico mio (my little one),” grandly
promised Jimmie.</p>

<p>To Francisco, Jimmie was an important person,
who had lived with the Cochise Chiricahuas, and called
the chief’s son “chi-kis-n” or brother, and spoke
Apache, and soon was going to be a real arriero or
else a scout, with the American soldiers.</p>

<p>Aside from a few scouting expeditions, the winter
at Camp Grant had been quiet. The agency for the
Arivaipas and Pinals was in operation, at the mouth
of the Arivaipa Canyon about a mile east; a Mr. Ed
Jacobs was the agent.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Chief Es-kim-en-zin’s people were
still afraid; they had not forgotten the attack by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
Tucson crowd. They came in around the agency
buildings every day, but every evening they went back
up into the canyon, where they might defend
themselves.</p>

<p>The Peace Policy and the visit by Commissioner
Colyer had not proved an entire success. A great
many Indians were still out. The Arizona newspapers
insisted that as long as General Crook was forbidden
to drive the outlaw Indians from their hiding-places,
the bad hearts who were simply using the reservations
would feel that they might do as they pleased, also.</p>

<p>There had been attacks upon ranches and mines and
stage stations in south and north both; the legislature
had called upon Congress for better protection to Arizona;
and General Crook was all ready. He was only
waiting.</p>

<p>“I think that the Apache is painted in darker
colors than he deserves, and that his villainies arise
more from a misconception of facts than from his being
worse than other Indians,” had reported the general,
after studying the situation. And he had added: “I
am satisfied that a sharp, active campaign against him
would not only make him one of the best Indians in
the country, but it would also save millions of dollars
to the Treasury, and the lives of many innocent whites
and Indians.”</p>

<p>The Indians on the reservations were complaining
of food and slack treatment; in New Mexico Chief
Victorio of the Warm Springs and Chief Cochise of
the Chiricahuas had refused to be changed from the
Cañada Alamosa; so the Government was sending out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
another peace commissioner. Brevet Major-General
O. O. Howard, to try to satisfy everybody.</p>

<p>He was to make especial effort to talk with Cochise,
who so far had declined to talk at all. Cochise and
Geronimo had claimed that they were willing to live
with Chief Victorio on the Warm Spring reservation,
but they had run away from Mr. Colyer, in fear of the
soldiers. They rarely went near the army post, there,
Fort Craig, and orders had been given that the soldiery
should leave them alone, so that they would continue
peaceful and contented, among the Warm Springs.</p>

<p>The President had hoped that Cochise would talk
with General Howard, who was a great chief like himself.
Now Cochise was “out” again!</p>

<p>“As far as I can savvy the trouble, that Colyer man
has spilled the soup,” complained Joe, this evening
after his return from Tucson. “Some o’ these agencies
are located in awful pore places, not fitted for the
Injuns at all—like that Date Creek reservation whar
the Apache-Mohaves are herded. But that Cañada
Alamosa of the Ojo Caliente (Warm Spring) country
jest suited old Victorio, an’ Cochise, too, an’ they
weren’t doin’ any harm.</p>

<p>“Now ’long comes Colyer, an’ he says to the Government:
‘The settlers ’round the Cañada Alamosa
don’t like to have the Injuns thar. It’s good cattle
ground, an’ they want it for themselves. So to avoid
hard feelin’s I recommend we move the Injuns all up
yonder to the Tularosa country, which nobody wants!’</p>

<p>“Natur’ly, bein’ as the same Injuns had been promised
the Cañada Alamosa if they’d live on it, an’ thar’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
plenty other land for the settlers, they see no good
reason for swappin’. They say that up at the Tularosa
the weather an’ land an’ water are as bad for Injuns
as for white men, an’ it’s ghost country. I tell ye,”
concluded Joe, “when you make an agreement with an
Injun you got to stand by it, or he’ll never believe
in you ag’in. You can’t fool him, or he’ll fool <em>you</em>!
I’m curyus to see what kind of a man this Gen’ral
Howard is.”</p>

<p>Jimmie, too, was “curyrus” to see this General
O. O. Howard, who was visiting the peaceful Yumas
and Pimas in western Arizona and was expected, any
day, at Tucson. His next stop probably would be
Camp Grant itself, so that he might talk with the
Pinals and Arivaipas.</p>

<p>Veteran Sergeant Warfield, who had served under
the general in the Union Army, at Antietam and
Gettysburg and in other big battles, said that he was
a great man, had commanded as high as thirty thousand
soldiers, in the field; had lost his right arm, by
two wounds, at the battle of Fair Oaks; was a hard
fighter and was very religious—knew the Bible by
heart and almost had resigned from the army to go into
“preaching.”</p>

<p>“But let me tell you this,” added the grizzled sergeant,
to Jimmie: “Arizony’ll find out that General
Howard’s a man who’ll see that right is done to both
white and red. He’s got a heap of sense, and he’s as
square as a piece of hard-tack.”</p>

<p>“A great American soldier chief is coming to talk
with the Arivaipa,” informed Jimmie, to old Santos,
at the reservation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span></p>

<p>“What does he want?” demanded Santos, in
Apache.</p>

<p>“He wants to make peace with all the Indians.”</p>

<p>“What good is peace?” retorted Santos. “The
Arivaipa asked for peace, and the white people and
the Papagos killed our women and stole our children.
We are still at peace, but none of our women and
children have come back, and we are hungry. We
would have done better to fight like the Chiricahua
and the Tonto.”</p>

<p>In a few days, or early in May, General Howard
did indeed appear at Camp Grant. He was traveling
in a six-mule army ambulance, with an escort of cavalry
from post to post. Colonel Crittenden and staff
rode out a short distance to meet him. The four companies
of Fifth Cavalry and Twenty-third Infantry
were drawn up, to receive him; their worn uniforms
brushed and every button and buckle polished.</p>

<p>General Howard certainly looked like a fine, soldierly
officer. He was as tall as, and rather heavier
than General Crook; with full brown beard and handsome,
lion-like countenance; in dusty campaign hat, and
double-breasted blue coat with two rows of brass buttons
down the front, and shoulder-straps bearing the
single star each of a brigadier general (which was his
regular rank), and with an empty right sleeve pinned
to his sword belt.</p>

<p>“Yep, I jedge he’s all right,” announced the ambulance
driver, to an inquiring group of soldiers and
scouts, after the parade had been dismissed. The
driver was a lean, lank, exceedingly solemn man who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
could not be induced to smile. “Only thing I have
against him is his callin’ me ‘Dismal Jeems’—him an’
his aide Cap’n Wilkinson. I dunno why. All the way
over from Fort Yumy I’ve tried my best to cheer ’em
up. I told ’em about every massacree along the hull
road; told ’em we were liable to be scalped, any mile;
told ’em all the cheerfulest things I could think of.
But somehow I didn’t make a hit. The gen’ral’s
powerful pious, too—holdin’ prayer-meetin’ on Sunday
an’ readin’ his Bible whenever he has a chance.</p>

<p>“But the Yumas an’ Pimas cottoned to him, an’
down at Tucson the people liked him fust-rate. The
Pimas an’ Papagos have promised to come in to a
council with the Arivaipas here next week, an’ the
Mexicans who have the Arivaipa kids have promised
to fetch ’em, an’ I s’pose when we all get together thar’ll
be a grand killin’ match. But I’m a cheerful man an’
alluz aim to look on the bright side o’ things.”</p>

<p>With that, “Dismal Jeems” drew a more melancholy
face than before, sighed heavily, and slouched
away to rub down his sweaty mules.</p>

<p>General Howard was not here to stay long, this
time. He spent most of one day at the agency; then
he left for Fort Whipple, to confer with General
Crook. But he was coming back; he had set May 21
as the date for the big peace council.</p>

<p>“What do you think of the soldier chief, Santos?”
asked Jimmie. Old Santos, ex-chief, usually was to
be found sitting in the sun, on the bench in front of the
agency store. He did not live in the hills with
Es-kim-en-zin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span></p>

<p>“The soldier chief is a good man. He pointed
to the sky and said: ‘I have a Father up there. So
have you. There is only one Father. Your Father and
my Father are the same. So you and I are brothers.’
That was a wise speech. We shook hands, and we are
brothers. I am glad. His words tell me that he is a
wise chief, and his sleeve tells me that he is a great
warrior. Now I trust him, because he thinks as I do.”</p>

<p>The council was held at the mouth of the Arivaipa
Canyon, exactly as General Howard had planned.</p>

<p>From their agency one hundred miles west, on the
Gila River, the Pimas came on time—twenty of them,
with their teacher, the Reverend Mr. Cook, and their
interpreter, named Louis.</p>

<p>From their agency at Camp Verde, fifty miles west,
some Tontos came; and some Apache-Mohaves, from
their agency at Date Creek, southwest of Prescott;
and a company of Papagos, from their homes south of
Tucson.</p>

<p>From Tucson itself there came a large delegation of
Americans and Mexicans, headed by Governor A. P. K.
Safford and the district attorney. Many of the Mexicans
were women, bringing the Arivaipa and Pinal
children whom they had adopted after the massacre.</p>

<p>The Pimas and the Papagos had long been enemies
of the Apaches, so they stayed together. The Tontos
and the Apache-Mohaves had been enemies of everybody,
so they stayed together. The Mexicans had been
enemies of the Tontos and the Apache-Mohaves and
the Arivaipas and Pinals, so they stayed together.
The Americans—the Tucson citizens and the scouts and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
ranchers—were ready to back up the guard of soldiers,
in case of trouble. But General Howard’s purpose
was to make peace between all the peoples of the
Southwest.</p>

<p>“Will there be a fight, you think, Jeem?” inquired
little Francisco. He and Jimmie had ridden
over early on one of the ranch mules, to see and hear
whatever might happen. “The Arivaipa will fight
to get their children, and the Pima will fight the Tonto,
and the soldiers will shoot; won’t they, Jeem?”</p>

<p>“Who knows?” replied Jimmie. “No, they
won’t!” he quickly added. “It is all right, chico.
Here comes General Howard. And see who is with
him! That is General Crook! Hooray!”</p>

<p>“Hooray!” echoed Francisco, who always tried
to do what Jimmie did.</p>

<p>For with its six mules at a gallop, and with General
Howard upon the seat beside “Dismal Jeems,” the
army ambulance had swung into the pretty green valley
along the Arivaipa Creek. Behind the ambulance followed,
in the road, a cavalcade of officers on horses
and mules. The first two were Colonel Crittenden
of Camp Grant, and a sinewy, powerful man, in a
brown canvas suit, on a mule. General Crook
himself!</p>

<p>He had come over with General Howard from Fort
Whipple. So had Lieutenant Bourke, and Lieutenant
Ross, and Lieutenant George Bacon of the First Cavalry,
and others of Jimmie’s old-time officer friends.</p>

<p>General Howard and party climbed out of the ambulance;
the other officers left their mounts with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
orderlies; and all crossed to the stools and benches reserved
for the “chiefs,” on the sod in the center of
the waiting circle.</p>

<p>“No Es-kim-en-zin yet,” whispered little Francisco.
“They stay away. I am afraid, Jeem.”</p>

<p>That was true. Only old short-legged Santos and
a handful of decrepid men and squaws were here;
Chief Es-kim-en-zin and his warriors had not appeared.
General Howard and General Crook and
Colonel Crittenden sat, waiting. So did the governor
and the district attorney. So did the Pima and Papago
and Apache-Mohave chiefs. Everybody waited.
Agent Jacobs plainly was worried, but it would not do
to show any sign of impatience.</p>

<p>“Dismal Jeems,” the ambulance driver from Fort
Yuma, circulated about, wagging his head and prophesying
that nobody would leave the spot alive! Yes, a
cheerful man was “Dismal Jeems.”</p>

<p>In about an hour, there was a sudden murmur of
interest. From the mouth of the Arivaipa Canyon
emerged Chief Es-kim-en-zin, leading his band of
Arivaipas and Pinals. They were in their best paint,
and advanced with much dignity to the place assigned
to them. Now the circle was complete.</p>

<p>For fifteen minutes no one spoke. General Howard
evidently understood that it was not proper to
hurry a council. Presently he arose, and through
Concepcion Equierre the interpreter, who spoke English
as well as he did Spanish and Apache, invited the
Arivaipa-Pinals to make a talk.</p>

<p>Es-kim-en-zin was first. He made a very poor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
talk, because he stammered, but he spoke thoroughly
in earnest, and so did others of his band. They
wanted their children back again.</p>

<p>The Mexicans who now had the children were invited
to reply. They said that the children were being
well brought up, as Christians; they loved them and
did not wish to return them to Indian life.</p>

<p>The governor and the district attorney spoke. They
said that it was better for Arizona and for the children
to have the children brought up in civilization. The
district attorney added that most of the children were
orphans, and that therefore the Territory of Arizona
was their guardian. Their own people were unable
to bring them up properly.</p>

<p>Es-kim-en-zin and his old men answered that it
was true that many mothers and fathers had been
killed; but the Arivaipa people wept for the little boys
and girls who had been stolen from them, and would
work hard to take good care of the children of their
race.</p>

<p>All the speeches in English and Apache were translated
into Apache and English by Concepcion Equierre,
the agency interpreter; and again into Spanish so that
the Mexicans and the Papagos and Pimas might understand
what was going on.</p>

<p>That evening the Es-kim-en-zin Arivaipa-Pinals
went back, six miles, up into their canyon. The other
delegations camped in the valley bottom around the
agency.</p>

<p>Jimmie and Francisco, on their mule, rode home
with Joe Felmer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<p>“It’s goin’ to be nip an’ tuck,” asserted Joe. “As
I understand, Gen’ral Crook he agrees with the gov’ner
an’ deestrict attorney that the children are better off as
they’re livin’ now. It may mean less Injuns to fight,
later. On the other hand, I heard that teacher-man
Cook talkin’ with his Pimas; an’ seems as though the
Pimas, who are ’most like white folks an’ hate the
’Paches, too, sorter think the kids ought to be given
back to their own kin. The Papagos’ll be ag’in it,
’cause they helped steal the children, an’ have used ’em.
The Tontos an’ Yavapais, bein’ ’Paches, will feel like
the Arivaipas do. But I have a notion Gen’ral
Howard’ll find a way, so everybody’ll be satisfied.”</p>

<p>It was not until the third day of the council that
General Howard found the way. Meanwhile both
parties were growing angry. Chief Es-kim-en-zin announced
that he could see no good in so many long talks.
The general spent the second night among the camps,
and slept on the ground there. In the morning he
made his final speech.</p>

<p>“The good Mr. Cook, of the Pimas, agrees with
me that the children ought to be returned to their own
people,” he said. “Some of them are being brought
up as slaves and servants, and they all were carried
off by force, which is not right. But the district
attorney from Tucson, and the governor, and other
honest persons, think differently, and I should listen to
their words, also. So we will take the matter to
Washington. I will appeal to my chief, who is the
Secretary of the Interior; and the district attorney
may appeal to his chief, who is the Attorney General<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
of the United States. And these chiefs will appeal
to President Grant, who is the greatest chief of all.</p>

<p>“While the President is deciding, the children shall
stay here at the agency with a good Christian white
woman whom I have engaged. They will be well
cared for, at government expense. Their relatives
and friends from the Arivaipas may visit them often,
and their Mexican friends may visit them often; and
our Great Father at Washington shall say who may
keep them.”</p>

<p>A cheer started, but the district attorney sprang
to his feet.</p>

<p>“We wish to keep the children until the President
decides. We will guarantee to do whatever he directs.”</p>

<p>“No guarantee is needed, from either side,”
severely answered General Howard. “Here is General
Crook. With his army and his authority he will
see to it that justice is done exactly as I have outlined!”</p>

<p>“Good!”</p>

<p>“Bueno, bueno!”</p>

<p>“Inju!”</p>

<p>The word was repeated in a perfect storm of
languages. The gathering was all excitement and
relief. Everybody seemed to approve of what the
general had said; that is, everybody except the district
attorney and a few scouts and ranchers who did not
believe in yielding peace terms to any Apaches
whatsoever.</p>

<p>The Arivaipa-Pinals and the Papagos and the
Pimas and the Apache-Mohaves and the Tontos hugged
one another; some of the Mexicans hugged some of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
Indians; General Crook and the officers laughed. It
was a happy solution of a serious problem.</p>

<p>“Kinder like a love-feast, after all, warn’t it!”
remarked Joe Felmer. “Huh! Wall, I reckon the
gen’ral knows how the President’ll decide.”</p>

<p>Probably General Howard did, for in due time the
children were given over to the Es-kim-en-zin band,
by orders from Washington, and Es-kim-en-zin always
remained at peace.</p>

<p>Amidst the hurly-burly of excitement Jimmie found
himself close to General Crook, who was talking earnestly
with Joe Felmer and old Jack Long. That was
his style; he did not go much on red tape, but spoke
direct to officers and enlisted men alike.</p>

<p>Here in his travel-stained canvas suit without any
mark of rank on it, he scarcely would be taken, again,
for a general commanding all the big Territory of
Arizona. He was thinner than when Jimmie had last
seen him, before; his face was lined, and he looked
as though he had been working hard, and worrying too.</p>

<p>His eyes, glancing aside, fell upon Jimmie, and
recognized him. To the beck of the general’s finger
Jimmie stepped forward and stood at attention.</p>

<p>“This is your boy, is he, Felmer?” The general
seemed to remember everything.</p>

<p>“Yessir, that’s what I call him.”</p>

<p>“He’s wearing rather more clothes than when I
first met him,” commented the general drily. “What
are you going to make of him?”</p>

<p>“Wall, he’s ondecided ’twixt scout an’ packer,”
drawled Joe. “He’s a leetle small yet, but he’s
growin’.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, an’ he’ll have plenty time to grow while
we’re all standin’ ’round waitin’ on the Government’s
Arizony pets to come in to their feed canvas when
they’re called!” grumbled old Jack. “He’s liable to
die of old age, if he ain’t sculped fust.”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut!” sharply reproved the general. “General
Howard’s doing good work. He’s the right man.
But this is not saying that there won’t be use for the
army. As for you, my boy,” he continued, to Jimmie,
“keep on learning to the best of your ability, so that
you’ll be ready for whatever comes.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” promised Jimmie.</p>

<small>THE HORRID DEED OF CHUNTZ</small></h2>
</div>


<p>General Crook had ridden back to Fort Whipple,
on his mule “Apache,” and General Howard had left
in the ambulance driven by “Dismal Jeems,” for Camp
Apache and the White Mountain reservation.</p>

<p>He had another good scheme. He was collecting
Indians from among the tribes, to take them with him
to Washington and the Great White Father, that they
might understand how many and powerful the white
people were.</p>

<p>Old Santos had agreed to go, for the Arivaipas.
The Pimas were sending their teacher, the Reverend
Mr. Cook, and Louis the interpreter, and the young
chief Antonito. The Papagos were sending their
chief, Ascencion. The Date Creek Apache-Mohaves
or Yavapais were sending Charlie and José.</p>

<p>Concepcion Equierre went from the Arivaipa
agency, to translate Apache.</p>

<p>The general expected to get some of the Sierra
Blanca or White Mountain Apaches, at the Camp
Apache reservation; and to invite the Chiricahuas, also.
He arrived safely at Camp Apache, and there added to
his party Chiefs Miguel of the one eye, Pedro and
Es-ki-tis-tsla; but he failed to find any Chiricahuas.</p>

<p>So he proceeded by wagon and mule, without them.</p>

<p>“I’d shorely like to see those Injuns’ faces when
the hull party strikes the railroad at Santy Fee!”
chuckled Jack Long. “They’ll think the Old Nick
is to tow ’em with his tail up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span></p>

<p>For Santa Fe of New Mexico Territory was the
nearest point east of Camp Grant reached by a railroad.</p>

<p>“What does a railroad look like, Jeem?” queried
little Francisco, hearing the talk.</p>

<p>Jimmie himself had not seen a railroad for several
years, but he remembered, and he tried to explain.</p>

<p>“It’s two lines of iron, like wagon-wheel tracks,
reaching miles and miles, chico,” he said. “And on
them roll fine wagons, joined together and filled with
people, and drawn by a—did you ever hear about
boats, chico? Those boats that sail up and down the
Colorado River, and make a big noise?”</p>

<p>Francisco eagerly nodded.</p>

<p>“My father has a brother who saw one.”</p>

<p>“Well, the thing that hauls the wagons is a steamboat
on land. It runs without horses; and it runs so
fast that it could go from here to Tucson, fifty-five
miles, in two hours.”</p>

<p>Francisco crossed himself.</p>

<p>“I would be afraid, Jeem,” he quavered.</p>

<p>Poor little Francisco! He was to meet a sad fate.</p>

<p>But, first, June and July passed quietly at Camp
Grant. From Fort Whipple General Crook continued
to keep scouting detachments and pack-trains moving.
The various posts were strengthened by troops and
supplies. The greater portion of the Fifth Cavalry
was in Arizona, with some troops of the First Cavalry,
and part of the Twelfth Infantry and of the Twenty-third
Infantry—the general’s regiment. The Twenty-first
Infantry and most of the Third Cavalry had gone
out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<p>The general was getting ready. According to the
officers of the Fifth Cavalry and the Twenty-third
Infantry at Camp Grant, the President had resolved
that if the Peace Policy in Arizona did not persuade
the Indians to settle down within a year, General
Crook should be ordered to take matters over.</p>

<p>The year would be up this September.</p>

<p>Then, in August, things “broke wide open,” as
Joe Felmer expressed it.</p>

<p>General Crook just escaped being assassinated by
the Yavapais at Date Creek, where he had gone for a
talk. He had angered them by arresting several of
them for the murder of Engineer Loring and others,
in the Wickenburg stage massacre. He had been told
that they were planning to kill him, but he went anyway.</p>

<p>They did try to shoot him, in the council. Lieutenant
Ross knocked up the arm of the Indian who fired
first, there was an all-round tussle, Hank Hewitt the
packer seized one Indian by both ears and broke his
head against a rock, a part of the Yavapais were killed
or imprisoned, and the rest fought their way into the
mountains.</p>

<p>The Tonto Basin Apaches—Tontos and Yavapais
both—were attacking ranches and mines south of Prescott.
Their worst chiefs were Chuntz, and Delt-che
(Delt-shay) or Red Ant (the Yavapais were known
as Red Ant people), and Cha-li-pun, the Buckskin-colored
Hat.</p>

<p>And on the road only thirty miles south of Tucson
the Chiricahuas killed gallant young Lieutenant Reid
Stewart, the “shave tail” who had been out of West<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
Point two months, and Corporal Black, while the two
were riding in a buck-board wagon up from Fort
Crittenden, for Tucson.</p>

<p>“An’ I hear now they’ve got Bob Whitney, at
last,” one day reported Joe Felmer, on return from
Tucson. “Yep; shot out his brains while he an’
Cap’n Gerald Russell o’ the Third were waterin’ their
hosses in the place called Cochise’s Stronghold of the
Dragoon Mountains, between Tucson an’ Bowie.”</p>

<p>Bob Whitney had been known as the handsomest
guide and scout in Arizona.</p>

<p>“Anyhow,” pursued Joe, “this sort o’ thing won’t
hang over, long. They told me at Lowell (Camp
Lowell, near Tucson, he meant) that orders have been
received from headquarters to be ready to take the
trail on short notice, an’ that the old man (who was
General Crook) is puttin’ on his war-paint and havin’
that mule ’Pache, o’ his, re-shod, four squar’.”</p>

<p>At the instant, while Joe was speaking in the ranch
yard, a sudden high chorus of shrill grief sounded,
down the road to Camp Grant. Up the course of the
sandy San Pedro Valley wended a slow little procession,
of men and women afoot and on mules.</p>

<p>The grief immediately spread to the ranch, where
the Mexican women began to run wildly, and shriek,
and tear their hair. Mrs. Vasquez, who was Francisco’s
mother, rushed by, to meet the procession.</p>

<p>“Mi niño! Ay, mi niño!” she wailed. “My
little boy! Oh, my little boy!”</p>

<p>How did she know? Joe Felmer gaped, puzzled;
and a cold fear seized Jimmie’s thumping heart.</p>

<p>Upon the seat of a two-wheeled, creaking cart in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
the midst of the procession Francisco’s father,
Domingo Vasquez, was sitting and holding in his arms
something wrapped in a blanket. He held it very
tightly.</p>

<p>Yes, it was poor little Francisco, killed by an
Apache lance-thrust. Joe Felmer scarcely could get
the story, amid all that shrieking and confusion; but
finally he and Jimmie learned from Domingo what had
happened.</p>

<p>“I take him with me in my cart to Camp Grant
this morning,” said Domingo, in Mexican-Spanish,
“while I cut wood along the Arivaipa, for the fort.
He visits with people I know, and I do not see him.
When I go to the fort to get him and come home, he
is not there. They say he has left to find me. We
hunt a long time, and we call, and he does not answer.
And then, next, they tell me he is found, and I see them
bringing him. Just a little way off the trail up the Arivaipa
from the fort somebody had found him, behind
a cactus there; and he was dead by an Apache lance.
Why should anybody kill my little boy—my niño, my
muchachito!—my little Francisco who never harmed?”</p>

<p>Why, indeed? Francisco was only a gay, innocent
little Mexican boy, alone, and too young to be an enemy.
The murder had been done at a turn of the trail within
rifle-shot from the fort. A party of Chief Chuntz’s
Tontos and Yavapais had been sneaking around the
post and the agency, pretending that they were ready
to come in. Old Santos insisted that the murderer
was a Chuntz warrior, if not Chuntz himself.</p>

<p>Santos was home again, after his trip east with
General Howard. He was filled with admiration of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
the ways of the white people. The general had given
him a New Testament, which he could not read, of
course, but which he placed under his head, every night,
when he slept.</p>

<p>“Chuntz is bad,” sympathized Santos, to Jimmie.
“He is bad and so are his men. All those Tonto and
Yavapai are bad at heart. To kill a boy is not Christian.
The only way to make those Tonto and Yavapai
good is to hunt them down. Cluke, the man with the
brown clothes, must go out after them, and after the
Chiricahua, too. I have told the Arivaipa what I
have seen among the white men. The white men
are many and very rich, and we will live like them if
they do not try to make us believe that the earth is
round. General Howard started to tell me that the
earth is round, but I answered that he and I are too
great chiefs, to be such fools as that!”</p>

<p>Little Francisco was laid away at the ranch. For
some time Jimmie felt sad and lonely. Francisco had
been his chum. The end was cruel and horrible.</p>

<p>So he was mighty glad when Joe sent him out with
old Jack Long, to help take a pack-train and bunch of
cavalry horses clear to Camp Bowie, by way of Tucson.</p>

<p>“An’, b’gosh, you’d better hustle back,” warned
Joe. “That Chuntz is a-goin’ to be made to pay for
his boy killin’, as soon as thar’s snow on the peaks.
The old man’s only waitin’ till winter sets in.”</p>

<p>It seemed high time that something was done. In
the past twelve months of Peace Policy over forty
Americans and Mexicans of Arizona had been killed
by the Apaches, sixteen wounded, and five hundred and
fifty cattle stolen.</p>

<small>ON THE TRAIL WITH THE PACK-TRAIN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>John Cahill, the new blacksmith at Grant, went;
but Joe had been appointed a scout, and stayed at home.</p>

<p>Tucson, only fifty-five miles south, was easily made
in two days, for the loose horses and the Grant pack-mules
traveled light. But Camp Bowie, at the Apache
Pass in the Chiricahua Mountains, was one hundred
and ten miles east from Tucson and Camp Lowell.
That meant a real march with thirty loaded mules, and
a hundred remount cavalry horses, and the cavalry
escort commanded by Lieutenant Jacob Almy, and a
riding-mule for each man of the pack-train.</p>

<p>The packs were chiefly ammunition. Each mule
carried three hundred pounds.</p>

<p>“We’ll jest see what we can do, boys,” said Jack.
“Regulations try to make us think that a hundred and
seventy pounds is all a mule’ll stand; but the gin’ral
knows more’n ary regulations issued by those folks at
Washington. I wouldn’t insult a good sound mule by
puttin’ only a hundred seventy on his back—not if he’s
packed right. Pack him right, so the load slings even,
an’ he’ll carry his two hundred fifty an’ three hundred
pounds at five miles an hour for twenty-five an’ thirty
miles a day, week in an’ week out.”</p>

<p>Old Jack was the pack-master or patron (pa-<em>trone</em>).
Frank Monach was assistant pack-master, or cargador
(car-ga-<em>dore</em>). “Slim Shorty” was cook or cencero<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
(cen-<em>say</em>-ro). Frank Cahill was blacksmith. The
packers or arrieros were Jim O’Neill, “Chileno John,”
“Long Jim” Cook (six feet eight), Charley Hopkins,
Sam Wisser the Pennsylvania German, and Lauriano
Gomez who sang Spanish songs.</p>

<p>The pack-train was called an atajo (ah-tah-ho); the
packs were “cargoes,” and the pack-saddles or aparejos,
and such stuff, composed the “riggings.”</p>

<p>Pack-train service had a language all its own. Yes,
and an army train as organized under General Crook
had a discipline all its own, too, as Jimmie soon found
out.</p>

<p>The trail from Tucson to Bowie was the main
Southern overland stage road between the Rio Grande
River in New Mexico and San Diego of the Pacific.
Therefore the traveling up hill and down was good.</p>

<p>It was Jimmie’s business to help herd the mules, in
the evening and the early morning, while the regular
herders were eating; and to come in and rouse the
cook, at daybreak, and get him wood and water, if
needed.</p>

<p>In half an hour after the cook was up, the men
were wakened. While they were folding their blankets
(which were the pack-blankets) and taking the canvas
coverings off the “riggings” and “cargoes,” Jimmie
brought in the herd.</p>

<p>This was not difficult, because when he started the
wise old bell leader, all the mules followed; and so
well had they been trained that except for a few “shave
tails” they took their own places, in a sort of company
front, each facing his pile of “rigging.” Every mule<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
had his own, individual “rigging,” adjusted to fit him
perfectly.</p>

<p>The packers saddled their riding mules, and ate
breakfast. After breakfast they put the “riggings”
and “cargoes” on the pack-mules.</p>

<p>They worked in pairs, and each pair attended to
ten mules. A full pack-train was composed of fifty
mules; ten mules were assigned to a troop or company
of soldiers. The thirty mules in this train of Patron
Jack called for six packers.</p>

<p>Jimmie helped “Slim Shorty” the cook pack his
kitchen stuff; and Jimmie and the cook and John
Cahill the blacksmith watched the loaded mules, especially
any “shave tails,” so that they should not ramble
away or try to lie down.</p>

<p>The packers worked like lightning, uttering scarcely
a word except signal words, for it was against regulations
to talk much. The schedule of breaking camp
or “unparking” a train was as follows: Twenty minutes
for before-breakfast work, fifteen minutes for
breakfast, twenty minutes for putting on the “riggings,”
twenty minutes for putting on the “cargoes”;
total, one hour and a quarter.</p>

<p>But “Chileno John” and Jim O’Neill, who were
the prize pair of packers, in an exhibition feat loaded
their ten mules complete (“riggings” and packs and
all) in ten minutes!</p>

<p>The moment that the train was ready, Patron Jack,
who had been eying closely, called “Bell!” and “Slim
Shorty” the cook rode the white bell mare out upon the
trail; in single file the pack-mules—“bell sharps” and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
“shave tails” and slow “drag tails”—stepped after,
usually of their own accord.</p>

<p>The cavalry escort took the advance. Patron Jack
and “Slim Shorty” led the pack-train. The packers
rode, one beside every fifth mule. Frank Monach
the assistant pack-master or “cargador” brought up
the rear, with John Cahill the blacksmith, whose business
it was to look out for dropped shoes and sore
hoofs.</p>

<p>Jimmie rode behind, too. The long file of swaying,
plodding mules, under the canvas-covered packs, made
a fascinating sight. So did the sturdy packers or
“arrieros,” in their broad hats and suspenders and
flannel shirts, and trousers tucked into heavy boots.</p>

<p>Jack aimed to start out by sun-up at the latest, so
as to finish the twenty-five or thirty miles at one stretch
before mid-day heat and dust. This was only a moderate
march, in fairly level country. In rough mountain
country, fifteen miles a day, at a go-as-you-can
gait, would be enough.</p>

<p>To unload and make camp was called “parking.”
The “riggings” and “cargoes” were laid out in two
neat parallel lines, and covered. Jack and Frank
Monach examined the mules, for sore backs caused
by badly fitting aparejos. The “bell” was hobbled
and turned to pasture and the mules followed.</p>

<p>“Riggings” were repaired, if necessary, and
scraped clean of sweat and dirt. The pack-blankets
were opened, to air for sleeping blankets; from their
war-bags, or canvas clothing sacks, the men took out
what stuff they required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<p>But the pack-mules were the main thought. Nothing
in the way of petting and fancy trappings was too
good for a pack-mule. Each mule had its name, and
knew that name. Nobody was permitted to strike a
mule or abuse it in any manner.</p>

<p>“You can abuse a dog an’ he’ll forgive you,” said
old Jack. “But you mistreat a mule, an’ he’ll never
forget. You can change yore clothes, but you can’t
change yore smell—not to a mule!”</p>

<p>The bell horse or “cencero” (which is the Spanish
for “bell”) had the easiest time of any of the pack-train
animals. It wasn’t packed. All that the “bell”
had to do was to tinkle along and set the pace, while
carrying the cook. The “bell” ought to be white,
because mules were supposed to be especially fond of
white; the “bell” ought to be a horse, because mules
respected a horse more than they did another mule;
and if “he” was a white mare, as in this train, then
so much the better, because mules loved white mares.</p>

<p>The cook rode the “bell,” and therefore was nicknamed
“cencero,” himself.</p>

<p>Patron Jack expected to make Camp Bowie in five
days easy, which would bring the pack-train and the
cavalry through in good condition. The first two
nights out, the mules were herded, to graze; but on the
third day the road crossed the Dragoon Mountains by
way of Dragoon Pass. This night the mules were tied
along a stretched picket-rope, for the Dragoon Mountains
were Chiricahua country, and contained Cochise’s
Stronghold.</p>

<p>“He’s off yonder at this very minute, an’ mebbe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
lookin’ for us,” declared Cargador Frank Monach.
“I’ll bet a cooky those hills south’ard are plumb full o’
Chiricahua.”</p>

<p>“That’s where they killed pore Bob Whitney, all
right enough,” mused Jim O’Neill. “Down at Dragoon
Springs, in the Stronghold. Yes, an’ many another
man has left his scalp there. That range westward
is the Whetstones, or Mustangs, where they got
Cushing; and on west of the Whetstones is Davidson’s
Canyon south of Tucson, where Lieutenant Stewart
and Corporal Black went under. By ginger, a fellow
doesn’t look out on a very pleasant view, from up
here!”</p>

<p>From the open Dragoon Pass of the stage road the
Dragoon Mountains, low and rolling but very rough,
with much brush and stunted timber, extended southward
to the Mexican line; and separated from them
by yellow deserts, west and east and north rose other
low ranges—all chosen hiding-places of the fierce
Chiricahuas.</p>

<p>“Anyhow,” remarked Jack Long, with a sly wink,
“we got a young chi-kis-n o’ theirs hyar—reg’lar member
o’ the Cochise fam’ly—to talk for us; an’ if ary
Chiricahua appear we’ll send him in to ’em.”</p>

<p>Jimmie grinned and scratched his head; whether
Cochise and Geronimo would wait and listen to him,
he wasn’t certain. But he’d rather like to see Nah-che
and Nah-da-ste, and explain why he had run away.</p>

<p>The stage and the mail riders had been attacked in
this very pass. However, nothing alarming happened,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
to-night. And the probable reason why, they learned
the next day.</p>

<p>Dragoon Pass was about half-way between Tucson
and Bowie, so that Bowie now lay some fifty miles east.
The Chiricahua Mountains and their Apache Pass
might be seen, in the eastern horizon.</p>

<p>The Chiricahuas had been so bad during the last
two months that the stage road was being little traveled.
And when, in the morning, on the way down
from the pass a cloud of dust was sighted before, everybody
stared, suspicious.</p>

<p>Horsemen! Injuns? No, cavalry! Good! A
scouting detachment from Bowie, as like as not; or
from Crittenden or Lowell, behind. Lieutenant Almy
met them first, and both parties stopped, to talk.
Patron Jack, at the head of the pack-train, spread
his two arms as signal for “Halt!” and he trotted on,
to join.</p>

<p>There was a lengthy confab.</p>

<p>“Wall, wonder what’s up?” drawled Frank Monach.
“Reckon I’d better go an’ see.”</p>

<p>“Send the boy, an’ save yore mule,” suggested
Blacksmith John Cahill. “He’s fairly itchin’ to sit
in.”</p>

<p>So Jimmie somewhat importantly trotted forward,
too, up the long line of dozing, switching pack-mules,
to bring back news if he heard any.</p>

<p>The party of riders from the east were several officers,
and three or four booted, flannel-shirted, whiskered
civilians, wearing heavy Colt’s six-shooters and
carrying rifles. Yes, and somebody else—a young<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
Mexican, dark enough to be an Apache, clad in broad-brimmed
black hat, dirty cotton shirt, old trousers and
moccasins.</p>

<p>Jimmie knew him in two looks. Maria Jilda
Grijalba! That same Maria who had been a captive
in the Cochise camp, and who, Micky Free had said,
had escaped after Jimmie had escaped.</p>

<p>Jimmie gladly rode straight to him.</p>

<p>“Buenos dias, Maria (Good day, Maria).”</p>

<p>“Buenos dias, amigo (friend),” responded Maria,
and they shook hands heartily.</p>

<p>“I heard you had escaped from the Apaches. What
are you doing here?”</p>

<p>“I have come out from Camp Bowie with these
officers,” answered Maria. “I work for the fort now.
I am a scout and interpreter. We are going to talk
with Cochise, at the Dragoon Springs.”</p>

<p>“What, amigo!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” nodded Maria. “General Howard, the
great man with the one arm, is there, with Cochise,
waiting. He has come from Washington again, and
has found Cochise. He has been in the Cochise camp
for six days. They have made peace. There will be
a Chiricahua reservation, and now General Howard
has sent for the comandante at Bowie, so that the
comandante and Cochise shall know each other, and
there will be no mistake.”</p>

<p>Maria spoke in Spanish except when an Apache
word seemed handier. Jimmie understood. It was a
great convenience to speak in two languages, at once.
As for Jimmie, he knew three languages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<p>“Would you like to go?” asked Maria. “You
come with me, and we will see Cochise, and Geronimo
and Nah-che and all of them.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to go, but I don’t believe I can, Maria,”
faltered Jimmie. “I’ve got to stay with the atajo.”</p>

<p>“Are you an arriero? Who is your patron?”
inquired Maria. “I will ask him.”</p>

<p>But Patron Jack Long already had the matter on
his tongue.</p>

<p>“Hyar’s a muchacho (boy) you can have, if you
want him, cap’n,” Jack was saying to the cavalry
captain. “He lived with old Cochise a while in these
very diggin’s. Speaks ’Pache, an’ consider’ble Mex.
Reckon we can spar’ him from the pack outfit, if you’ll
fetch him back to Bowie ’fore we leave thar.”</p>

<p>“Does he speak English, though?” demanded the
captain. “I’ve got a guide with me—Maria, there—who
speaks Mexican and Apache.”</p>

<p>“Does he savvy Americano? Sure he does, bein’
that his name’s Jimmie Dunn, an’ his folks were both
’Mericans ’fore the ’Paches got ’em, an’ he’s been
brung up by Joe Felmer at Grant. Speak American?
Speaks it better’n I do, ’cause he had schoolin’ back
East.”</p>

<p>“All right. I’ll take him, and much obliged to
you,” said the captain. “Lived with Cochise, did he?
How was that?”</p>

<p>“’Cause he couldn’t help it. Thar warn’t any
‘how’ to it, ’cept the ‘how’ o’ stayin’ close an’
playin’ possum till he had a chance to skip out. The
Chiricahua jumped him an’ some o’ Pete Kitchen’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
sheep south o’ Tucson a couple o’ year ago, an’ tuk
him along same time they tuk yore Mexican. That
Maria Jilda an’ him were captives together. He’s
chi-kis-n to Nah-che, old Cochise’s son. But he’s
plumb American ag’in, now. If you meet up with any
’Paches an’ want to talk with ’em, he’ll interpret for
you.”</p>

<p>“Hah!” exclaimed the cavalry captain, eying Jimmie,
as did the other men. “He’ll do finely, then.
Come with us, boy. We’ll return you to your outfit
to-morrow. Let’s go on, gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“Wall, I don’t wish you any hard luck—or that
Gin’ral Howard, either,” called Jack, after—for Jack
said whatever he chose. “But ’cordin’ to my notion
the peacefulest kind o’ Chiricahua is a dead Chiricahua,
an’ you can tell Cochise Jack Long says so. Hey,
Jimmie!” continued Jack. “You tell yore chi-kis-n
to tell his dad thar’s a gent in a canvas suit, up at
Whipple, who’s comin’ down hyar pronto (quick)
with a double-bar’l ‘peace policy’ guaranteed to turn
wild ’Paches into tame ones.”</p>

<p>They left Lieutenant Almy’s little detachment starting
onward, and old Jack grumbling as he signaled his
pack train to “march.”</p>

<small>IN THE STRONGHOLD OF COCHISE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Riding on beside Maria, Jimmie learned more
about General Howard and the Chiricahuas.</p>

<p>The general had returned as far as the Warm
Spring reservation in New Mexico, with Pedro and
Miguel and Santos and the other delegates to Washington.
Then he had engaged two Warm Spring
guides—young Chie, son of Mangas Coloradas, and
Ponce, son of another of Cochise’s old-time friends;
and with them, and Captain Sladen his aide, and Tom
Jeffords, a red-haired, red-bearded American trader
whom the Chiricahuas never harmed, he had proceeded
right on west, into the mountains, to find Cochise.</p>

<p>The rest of his party he had dismissed, to wait for
word from him, at Bowie.</p>

<p>It had been anxious waiting, for who might foretell
what Cochise would do? But suddenly, one day, the
general had appeared again, at Bowie, with only Chie
as companion. He had met Cochise, in the Stronghold;
had talked with him, as man to man; and now he
was here, in order that the word should be sent out all
along the line: “The Cochise Chiricahuas have promised
peace. Do not interfere with them.”</p>

<p>With that, he had immediately returned to the
Stronghold; and now Captain S. S. Sumner, commanding
Camp Bowie, and several of his officers and a
few civilians, were outward bound, to be present at the
council.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<p>“Do you think that the Chiricahua have quit forever,
Maria?” asked Jimmie, as they jogged along.</p>

<p>“Maybe yes, maybe no,” replied Maria, shrugging
his shoulders. “If they might believe all Americans
like they believe that one-armed man—but who knows?
Anyway, he is not afraid, and he speaks truth. What
kind of a man is that other general, the comandante
named Crook?”</p>

<p>“They can believe him, too,” asserted Jimmie.
“He’s a fighting general, and a peace general, both.
He’ll carry war to those Apaches that stay bad. He’s
ready now to move against the Tonto.”</p>

<p>“Good,” grunted Maria.</p>

<p>The abandoned stage station of Dragoon Springs,
on the west slope of Dragoon Pass, had been appointed
as the council place. No Chiricahuas and no token
of any council were sighted here; but a stout, broad-shouldered
officer with black hair and heavy “shoe-brush”
moustache met the Captain Sumner party in
the road.</p>

<p>He was Captain Sladen, General Howard’s aide.
He said that the Chiricahuas had seen soldiers in the
road, this very morning; therefore Cochise insisted that
the council be held off at one side, where the Chiricahuas
might protect themselves.</p>

<p>Guided by Captain Sladen on a narrow saddle trail
running south, the party rode a mile or two, through
a rolling park of grass and oaks and mountain mahogany—and
then here came General Howard and his
Chiricahuas!</p>

<p>Haw, haw! Even the sober Maria laughed. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
general was aboard a mule, and behind his saddle sat a
painted, naked Chiricahua, holding fast with both arms
around the general’s waist! <a href="#i_131">It was the piercing-eyed
Geronimo!</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_131">
  <img src="images/i_131.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_131">IT WAS THE PIERCING-EYED GERONIMO!</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>That was a great position for a brevet major-general
of the United States army; but it looked
“friendly”!</p>

<p>A large cavalcade of warriors painted and
weaponed pranced on every side. They left a little
space about a red-painted horseman who stayed near
the general.</p>

<p>“Cochise,” said Maria. “I see Taza, too; and
Nah-che.”</p>

<p>The Chiricahuas uttered a loud whoop. At signs
from the red-painted horseman they spread right and
left along the opposite edge of this park. When the
Bowie party and Captain Sladen arrived, General
Howard and the Cochise company were waiting.</p>

<p>“D’yuh notice?” remarked Jack May, one of the
men who had been sent to Bowie by the general.
“Ev’ry bronc’ (‘broncho’ was a name for the wild
Chiricahuas) is stationed where he can dive into that
little canyon an’ be out o’ sight in a jiffy. Those fellows
are smart.”</p>

<p>Cochise had daubed all his face with vermilion.
He seemed tense and excited. His large black eyes
darted to and fro, searching for treachery. His hair
was graying, Jimmie observed; he had grown much
older.</p>

<p>Taza was here. And in the background, Chato<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
and Nah-che. Jimmie signed to Nah-che, and Nah-che
responded, but he did not dare to come over, yet.</p>

<p>The council was begun at once, with General
Howard and officers, and Cochise and his captains, sitting
in the middle of the circle.</p>

<p>A tall red-bearded man, who was Tom Jeffords the
trader, did the interpreting.</p>

<p>“The Great White Father has sent me to make
peace between the Chiricahua and the Americans,”
said General Howard.</p>

<p>“Nobody wants peace more than I do,” answered
Cochise. “I have done no harm since I came from
the Cañada Alamosa. My horses are few, and I am
very poor. Once we were a large people. We lived
well, at peace with everybody except the Mexicans. But
one day the soldiers seized my best friend and killed
him when he was in prison. Right there at Apache
Pass other soldiers hung up my brother, after they
had attacked me when I had surrendered. So I have
fought the Americans and the Mexicans, but the Chiricahua
are getting less every day. Why shut us up on
a reservation? We will keep the peace, but we wish
to go around free, the same as other people.”</p>

<p>“That cannot be,” kindly explained the general.
“Some bad white men might fire on you, or some of
your wild young men might fire at the white men.
Then the peace would be broken. The Great White
Father, who is President Grant, will agree that you live
at the Cañada Alamosa. That is a fine country, and
you liked it.”</p>

<p>“We would be there now if the white people had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
not driven us off,” answered Cochise. “They might
drive us off again, and I will not go to the Tularosa.
The Apaches there get sick, and die. Give me Apache
Pass. That is my home. I will protect all the trails.
I will see that nobody is harmed by any Indians. But
my people will not go back to the Cañada Alamosa.
They are afraid. They would not be allowed to stay
there.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said the general, “we will give you this
country right here. We cannot give you Apache Pass.
We will fix the boundaries at once. Does that suit
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” declared Cochise, pleased, “that is good.
We will keep my Stronghold, and the country around,
of the Dragoon Mountains and the Sulphur Springs
Valley.”</p>

<p>“It is settled,” agreed the general. “I have full
authority to say so. This shall be your country forever,
if you keep the peace. See, I place this stone
upon the mesa.” He moved a rock. “Now, as long
as this stone lasts, so long shall last the peace between
the Chiricahua and the Americans. You may have
your friend Tom Jeffords for agent.”</p>

<p>“That is good,” repeated Cochise. “Staglito
(Red Beard) is our friend.”</p>

<p>“You must send for all your Chiricahua to come
in. Tell them that when they are off the traveled roads
they must show a white flag of peace, so that there will
be no mistakes. When they are on a traveled road
they must meet other people without any running or
fear, as the white people do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>

<p>“That is good,” approved Cochise. “The stone
lies on the mesa. The white people and the Chiricahua
will drink of the same water and eat of the
same bread, and be at peace.”</p>

<p>Now there was a shaking of hands all around,
and the general and Captain Sumner and Tom Jeffords
proceeded to arrange with Cochise and Geronimo the
boundaries of the Chiricahua reservation.</p>

<p>“Let us talk with Nah-che,” proposed Jimmie, to
Maria. There had been no call for them in the interpreting,
and now was their chance to look up Nah-che.</p>

<p>“Chi-kis-n,” greeted Jimmie, extending his hand
to grasp Nah-che’s.</p>

<p>“Welcome, chi-kis-n,” replied Nah-che, as they
shook.</p>

<p>Nah-che had grown into almost a warrior.</p>

<p>“How is Nah-da-ste?”</p>

<p>“She is not here. The women and children are
in another place, till the chiefs know whether it is peace
or war.”</p>

<p>“It is peace, chi-kis-n.”</p>

<p>“I think so,” answered Nah-che frankly. “The
Chiricahua wish peace. They will keep their promise
if the white people will keep theirs. As long as Staglito
stays with us, there will be no trouble, because he
understands us. All these wars between the Americans
and the Apaches come because they do not understand
each other. I think if there were more one-armed
soldier-captains there would be fewer wars.
That other soldier-captain, Cluke, is honest, too, we
hear. Why doesn’t he come to see us?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<p>“He is getting ready to fight those Indians who
are bad,” said Jimmie. “He was told to wait until the
one-armed general had offered the Chiricahua peace.
Now he will go to war against the Tonto and the
Yavapai, who have refused peace.”</p>

<p>Taza joined them, and shook hands. He was
carrying a beautiful breech-loading rifle—an officer’s
rifle. Eying it curiously, Jimmie suddenly recognized
it. It had been the rifle of stripling Lieutenant Reid
Stewart, the dandy “shave tail”—it was the only one
of its kind—engraved so fancifully; that is, Jimmie had
seen the lieutenant with it, at Camp Grant; and now
Taza had it!</p>

<p>Taza must have noticed Jimmie stiffen and choke,
for he said, in Spanish:</p>

<p>“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">No trieste, hermano</i> (Do not feel badly,
brother).” And in Apache, “We all do things in war
that we would not do in peace.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, on the way to Camp Bowie, after the
council, Jimmie could not forget the sign of Lieutenant
Reid’s rifle, in the Chiricahua camp. He was such
a young officer, to have been killed so soon, without
having had a chance to defend himself. And Cochise
had declared that his people had done no harm since
leaving the Cañada Alamosa!</p>

<p>But then, that was Indian way. And Apaches had
been killed, too, by the white men. War was a cruel
game.</p>

<p>General Howard did not return to Camp Bowie.
He had gone the other way, to Tucson, with his party
and his ambulance. From Tucson he was going to San<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
Francisco, to report to General Schofield; and from
there he was going to Washington.</p>

<p>He certainly had accomplished a great work,
only——</p>

<p>“Will the peace last as long as the stone, do you
think, Maria?” asked Jimmie.</p>

<p>“The white people will break the stone, amigo
mio,” said Maria. “Some day they will break the
stone, because they want the land where it lies. Then
there will be war again, and you and I will fight
Nah-che. But Cochise spoke straight. The Chiricahua
in Arizona are tired. Did you hear about the
joke on the one-armed general?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Nyle-chie-zie, who is Cochise’s brother-in-law,
wanted to trade two of his young wives to the general
for the general’s four wagon-mules. The general said
he already had a wife. But the girls said that made
no difference; they would all get along together nicely.
If the general had not explained that the laws of the
Americans forbade him to have more than one wife
at a time, he might have been in much trouble, I think.”</p>

<p>“Yes, many wives at once are a trouble,” asserted
Ponce, who, with Chie, was returning to the Warm
Spring bands. “The soldier-captain saw Cochise’s
hand. That is why he refused the two girls!”</p>

<p>“What was the matter with Cochise’s hand?”
queried Jimmie.</p>

<p>They all were talking in Apache.</p>

<p>“Those two big holes in it are where one of his
wives bit him. He was afraid he would be sick, so
he burned the places.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span></p>

<p>“The one-armed soldier-captain is very wise,”
laughed Chie. “He does not wish to lose the only
hand he has.”</p>

<p>“But it is true that white people are allowed only
one wife at a time,” insisted Jimmie. However, Ponce
and Chie did not act as though they believed this.</p>

<p>Camp Bowie was reached early the next morning.
It was a small army post, about the size of Grant, composed
of log and adobe buildings set in a clearing on a
hill in the middle of the celebrated Apache Pass over
the Chiricahua Mountains that extended on southward
into Mexico. The pass was long and rolling,
between high brushy, thinly timbered slopes. Bowie
commanded the stage road both ways for two or three
miles.</p>

<p>This had been Cochise’s favorite resort, in former
days. At the east end of the pass was where his
brother had been hanged, after the fracas eleven years
ago, or in 1861. There had been no Camp Bowie,
then; only the stage station.</p>

<p>But Bowie was established the next year, 1862—the
same year as Camp Grant—and like Camp Grant,
since that time it had been trailing Apaches almost
every day. What with the attacks on the stages, east
and west, and on livestock, and what with the vengeful
ambushing of the soldiers themselves, by the Chiricahuas,
anybody stationed at Bowie was certain to
have plenty of excitement. Why, the graveyard there
was enough to give one the shudders. It was a famous
graveyard.</p>

<p>Before inspecting the graveyard, Jimmie reported<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
to Jack Long. Jack and the pack train were here.
So was Lieutenant Almy, being entertained by brother
officers of the Fifth and Third Cavalry.</p>

<p>“So it’s sure ’nough peace, is it?” commented
Patron Jack, after he had heard the story of everything
that had occurred near Dragoon Springs. “All
right. Gin’ral Howard means well, like as not. But
did you tell old Cochise what I said? No? Humph!
One thing’s sartin, anyhow: if he was put on trial before
a jury o’ Arizony people, they’d vote yewnanimous
to hang him an’ half his band. Yes, sir-ee.”</p>

<p>“You bet yuh,” chimed in Slim Shorty, the cencero.</p>

<p>And, as a matter of fact, when the general arrived
at Tucson, the newspaper and people there talked just
as Jack talked. They said that Cochise should be
punished, instead of being granted a reservation, and
his Stronghold, for his own. Nevertheless, Cochise
stayed there, true to his word, until he died, in 1874;
and Taza also kept from war, until in 1876 he died.
But with Geronimo and Nah-che matters went different,
just as Maria prophesied.</p>

<p>“Now I will show you the graveyard, amigo,”
proffered Maria, when Jimmie had been dismissed from
duty, by old Jack.</p>

<p>The graveyard really was about the only thing of
consequence to see, at Bowie. It was the largest graveyard
at any of the army posts in Arizona. The many
wooden slabs, marking the resting-place of soldier
and traveler, read much alike, except for the names.</p>

<p>“Killed by the Apaches.” “At the Hands of the
Apaches.” “Victim of the Apaches.” “Met his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
Death by Apaches.” “Of Wounds Inflicted by the
Apaches.” And so forth, and so forth.</p>

<p>Maria seemed to be proud of this collection, but
it was too melancholy for Jimmie. He was very glad
when, on a sudden, a series of loud whoops attracted
his attention. A short, brick-topped, familiar figure in
old shirt outside of old trousers, was beckoning to
him, on the way from the parade ground. A trumpet
was blowing “Boots and Saddles,” cavalrymen were
running to the stables, and packers were hustling at
the post mule-corral.</p>

<p>So Jimmie legged back, to find out what was up.
Micky Free, the red-head, met him, and grinned delightedly,
his one blue eye sparkling. Micky had
started a moustache, red like his hair. He showed
hard travel.</p>

<p>“Hello, Cheemie. Your patron says for you to
come quick, if you want to go to Camp Apache.”</p>

<p>“When did you get in, Micky?” panted Jimmie,
as they trotted on together.</p>

<p>“Just now. Alchisé (Al-chi-say) and I bring dispatches.
The canvas suit general is at Camp Apache,
and everybody is to join him there, to go against the
Tonto.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XII">XII<br />
<small>GENERAL CROOK RIDES AGAIN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“That’s right,” Patron Jack was urging, among
the fast working men. “Move yore feet, hombres, or
the cavalry’ll beat you. The old man’s up yonder,
waitin’ on his mule, with both bar’ls loaded. Mebbe
it’s peace in the south but it’s war in the north.” And
to Jimmie: “Say, muchacho! Thar’s livelier things’n
graveyards. We’re goin’ after Chuntz an’ the rest o’
those boy murderers. So you jump an’ help the cook.”</p>

<p>Alchisé and Micky Free had brought orders from
General Crook at Camp Apache to Lieutenant Almy
to join him there at once with all the cavalry and
pack-mules that could be spared from Camp Bowie.</p>

<p>Of course, the orders had not explained why; but
the busy-minded Micky asserted that everybody at
Apache knew why: they knew why, because the Sierra
Blanca or White Mountains had been asked to send
their young men with the soldiers and help to drive
the bad Tontos and Apache-Mohaves out of the Tonto
Basin. These Tontos and Yavapais were making
trouble between the white men and the red.</p>

<p>The pack-train was ready first. In an hour the
cavalry were ready, and the column moved out of
Bowie, for Camp Apache, two hundred miles by trail
north across the mountains.</p>

<p>Maria had to stay behind, at Bowie.</p>

<p>“Good-by, amigos,” he bade, to Jimmie and Micky.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
“Some day we will go together against the Chiricahua,
with your Crook.”</p>

<p>There were fifty cavalry, mainly of the Fifth Regiment,
and some fifty pack-mules which carried only
supplies for the march. Micky and Alchisé led by
the best trail, so that the trip was made in five days.</p>

<p>Now Jimmie had an opportunity to see the famous
Camp Apache, in the grassy, well timbered and well
watered Sierra Blanca or White Mountains of northeastern
Arizona. By reason of the fine hunting and
fishing, and scenery and climate, it was considered to
be the prize army post of the Southwest.</p>

<p>It had been located in 1870, and was at first called
Camp Ord, and Camp Thomas. The Chiricahuas had
sneered at the White Mountain Apaches, who had permitted
a soldier fort to be established among them.
But Chiefs Pedro and Miguel and Pi-to-ne and all had
continued to live just west of the post, and to remain
tame Indians. In this they were wise.</p>

<p>With the twelve hundred tame Indians, and the
many soldiers, some infantry but the majority cavalry,
Camp Apache proved to be a stirring place. General
Crook had arrived, with his escort; clear from Fort
Whipple, two hundred and fifty miles west. He had
traveled fast, breaking camp by four o’clock every
morning, and now he was hustling matters so that he
might set out for Camp Grant, to the southwest, and
organize an expedition from there.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Bourke was at work enlisting the White
Mountain young men. Most of the White Mountains
were very anxious to take the war-path against the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
bothersome outlaw Tontos and Yavapais. Alchisé enlisted,
so did Na-kay-do-klunni, so did a sub-chief
named Es-qui-nos-quiz-n or Big Mouth, so did Nan-ta-je
(Nan-tah-hay), a Coyotero; so did nearly one
hundred others.</p>

<p>Micky knew every one of them. But his band was
the Chief Pedro band.</p>

<p>“Are you coming, Micky?” eagerly asked Jimmie.</p>

<p>“Maybe. I will wait and see, Cheemie, until I
can tell where there’ll be the best fighting.”</p>

<p>“We’ll catch the Tonto, won’t we, Micky?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” assured Micky. “That Cluke is cunning.
All the way over he saw that the water of the
high places was frozen; winter has come and the Tonto
and Yavapai will be staying home. They cannot move
their rancherias, easy. I will go to Camp Grant with
you, anyway,” added Micky. “But don’t say so, to
other people. I am not an Apache. I will do as I
please.”</p>

<p>General Crook did not delay an instant at Camp
Apache after he had turned his orders into action.
Upon the second morning after the arrival of the reinforcements
from Camp Bowie he started, with cavalry
and pack-mules and those White Mountain scouts who
were ready, for Camp Grant.</p>

<p>He directed that the rest of the Apache scouts were
to follow, in three days. They would find many other
Indians at Camp Grant, who would try to be braver
than the Sierra Blanca.</p>

<p>“My young men will show how the White Mountains
can fight,” had answered old Pedro.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span></p>

<p>General Crook was in a great hurry.</p>

<p>“Yuh see,” explained Patron Jack, to the men
who were astonished by being roused out at two in the
morning and led on without a halt until late afternoon,
“the old man’s promised to meet a lot more chiefs at
Grant, besides those Sierra Blancas, an’ he knows he’s
got to keep his word. If you don’t keep yore word
with Injuns, they call you a liar.”</p>

<p>The distance by trail from Apache to Grant was a
little more than one hundred miles—but each mile, as
Cargador Frank Monach put it, meant one mile up, two
miles down, and one mile across! Alchisé and Archie
MacIntosh the Hudson Bay trapper, were the guides.
Micky Free had not appeared, at the start; and when
Jimmie, disappointed, inquired about him of Alchisé,
Alchisé claimed to know nothing about Micky. He
only shrugged his shoulders, and grunted:</p>

<p>“Maybe come, maybe stay. Who can tell?”</p>

<p>The second day’s march was terrific, into canyons
and out again; and when darkness fell the column was
still struggling to find a camping-place. The mules
and the cavalry horses had all they could do to keep
their feet amidst the brush and rocks; the general rode
from head to rear, encouraging, and looking after men
and mules—he sought no rest, for himself, and everybody
worked like a demon. But Alchisé and Archie
MacIntosh, in trying a short cut, had missed the trail.</p>

<p>Jimmie was toiling and urging with the rest, in the
depths of a star-canopied black canyon, when he heard
a laugh, close at his ear, and a voice that said, in
Apache:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span></p>

<p>“Why do you work so hard, Boy-who-sleeps? Are
you afraid the Tonto will get away?”</p>

<p>It was Micky Free, bareback on a mule. He could
scarcely be seen, but Jimmie recognized his speech.</p>

<p>“Where did <em>you</em> come from?” demanded Jimmie
crossly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am here,” laughed Micky. “I know all
this country very well. I told you I was going to
Camp Grant.”</p>

<p>“Then you’d better get to work,” retorted Jimmie.
“I haven’t any time to talk.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t come to work; I came to fight the
Tonto,” laughed Micky. “But the rest of you had
better work, or I’ll be the only one to get to Camp
Grant.”</p>

<p>Amidst the hurly-burly of stumbling mules and
perspiring packers Jimmie lost him, and did not sight
him again until long after sunrise the next morning,
when at last the command was out of the canyons and
the wearied pack-train followed the cavalry into camp.</p>

<p>Micky was already there, ahead, squatting beside
Alchisé. He arose and came back to where Jimmie
was helping Slim Shorty, the cook.</p>

<p>“Alchisé says there will be some good fights,
Cheemie,” remarked Micky. “Now I want you to
take me to your general, so that he will know who
I am.”</p>

<p>“Aw, pshaw, Micky!” protested Jimmie. And in
Apache: “I can’t. I’m busy. The general wants to
eat and sleep, and so do I.”</p>

<p>“Who is this one-eye?” asked Slim Shorty.
“Where’s he from an’ what’s his trouble?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span></p>

<p>“His name’s Micky Free. He was with the Pedro
band and helped me get away from the Chiricahua.
He asks me to take him to the general.”</p>

<p>“What! Tell him to chase himself. ’Tain’t any
time for payin’ social visits,” growled Slim Shorty.
“It’s grub time an’ sleep time, an’ you’re workin’ for
me. Savvy that?” Slim Shorty was cross, like
everyone else. Twenty-six hours straight had they
been climbing and threshing about.</p>

<p>“Here comes your general now,” prompted Micky.
“He doesn’t eat or sleep. You can take me to him
when he passes, Cheemie.”</p>

<p>Sure enough, General Crook, on the faithful mule
“Apache,” was ambling slowly from group to group,
through the camp; in his stained canvas suit, his shot
gun across his saddle! He seemed to be on a tour of
inspection, with particular regard for the pack-mules.</p>

<p>As he passed, the men stiffened to their feet, and
stood at attention. He dropped a word here and there,
and halted briefly at Slim Shorty’s fire. Slim stood at
attention, so did Jimmie, but Micky only waited, red-headed,
lightly clad, grinning amiably.</p>

<p>“Feed your men well, cook,” bade the general.
“They’ve earned double rations. I see you’ve got a
good supply of beans. That’s right. Always set your
beans to cook the night before, and they’ll be much more
wholesome.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Slim Shorty. “But these
hyar beans won’t be done till noon. There warn’t any
‘night before,’ this last trip. Got plenty bread, bacon
an’ coffee, though.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, in that case——,” smiled the general. His
face was a little drawn, but he didn’t look especially
tired, and neither did Apache. “How are you, my
lad?” he queried, of Jimmie, and his eyes fell upon
Micky. “Who’s this? I didn’t know he was with
the column. I’ve seen him at Camp Apache. His
name is Micky Free.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Jimmie. “He lives with
Chief Pedro’s band of Sierra Blanca. He helped me
get away from the Chiricahua camp, that time.”</p>

<p>“He’s not Apache?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. He’s half Mexican and half Irish.”</p>

<p>“What’s he doing here? Is he enlisted with the
scouts?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so, sir,” faltered Jimmie. “Not
with the Apache scouts. He isn’t Indian. He followed
us. He asked me to tell you that he wants to
fight the Tonto, though.”</p>

<p>“Well, well. That’s all right, but I haven’t time
to tend to that now, my boy,” replied the general.
“I’m going after some breakfast. Let him report to
Lieutenant Bourke. Bourke has charge of the scouts.
When we get to Grant we’ll give him a chance to fight.”
And the general rode on. He kept going, until he disappeared
around a shoulder in some low ground. He
did not return for two hours, and then he brought back
a load of reed birds, for the officers’ mess. What a
man!</p>

<p>“What did he say?” inquired Micky, who spoke
no English, of Jimmie.</p>

<p>“He said to have you report to Lieutenant Bourke,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
and when we got to Grant you would be shown
fighting.”</p>

<p>“That is good,” approved Micky. “I don’t care
anything about your Lieutenant Bourke, but the general
has promised me fighting and I like him. I will go
to Grant, and then we will chase the Tonto with the
general, Cheemie; you and I.”</p>

<p>So saying, Micky strolled away, to eat with Alchisé.
Throughout the remainder of the march to Camp Grant
he did about as he pleased: sometimes he rode in advance,
with Alchisé and Archie MacIntosh; and sometimes
he rode with Jimmie, at the rear; and sometimes
he vanished, to explore on his own hook. But he
always turned up at meal times!</p>

<p>With his ragged clothes, and his red head and his
smudgy reddish upper lip and his one bright blue eye,
Micky was a privileged character.</p>

<p>Camp Grant was reached exactly on time, and for
the next three days of this first week in November it
was a busy place. Dispatch bearers came and went;
Chief Packer Tom Moore was here, from Whipple;
one hundred White Mountain scouts arrived, under
Chief Es-qui-nos-quiz-n or Big Mouth; Pima and
Maricopa chiefs were waiting, to talk with “Cluke”
and find out what he wanted; word came that the Hualpais
were ready, for they also hated the Apaches, as
the Pimas and Maricopas did. But Chief Es-kim-en-zin
refused to let any of his young men enlist; the
Arivaipas had friends among the outlaw Pinals who
ranged near the Tonto Basin.</p>

<p>Every officer and enlisted man and pack-mule that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
could be spared from the various posts, and every
Indian who could be trusted off the reservations, was
called into service. Jimmie felt certain that he ought
to be included; he had done his level best, on the trip
around by Bowie and Apache—nobody had worked
harder. So he anxiously consulted Joe Felmer.</p>

<p>“Wall, you see it’s this way,” said Joe: “I’m goin’
as scout—Archie MacIntosh, Tony Besias, an’ me,
’long with the Major Brown column. That keeps us
in advance, an’ ’twon’t be any place for a boy. This
is war. So you stick ’round old Jack; he’ll boss the
pack-train, an’ I happen to know that he thinks purty
well o’ you. He says you tended strictly to bus’ness,
an’ obeyed orders.”</p>

<p>Jimmie looked up Patron Jack.</p>

<p>“Shore thing, muchacho,” answered Jack. “I
told you I’d make a fust-class packer of you, an’ I will.
You fetch yore war-bag an’ fall in ready to help the
cook’ an’ by the time we’re out o’ the Tonto Basin with
old Chuntz’s scalp mebbe you’ll get a second-class
ratin’.”</p>

<p>Hurrah! It was only proper, too, for Chief Chuntz
had murdered little Francisco, and had not little Francisco
been his, Jimmie’s, partner? Everybody at Grant
was particularly eager to kill or capture Chuntz.</p>

<p>“To-morrow we start,” remarked Micky. “Where
is the Gray Fox, Cheemie?”</p>

<p>“Who is that, Micky?”</p>

<p>“Cluke. He is the Gray Fox, because of his
smartness and his dirt-color clothes. All the Indians
are calling him the Gray Fox. Where is he?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know. He is visiting other forts, getting
the soldiers ready.”</p>

<p>And that was true. General Crook was leaving
nothing at loose ends, but instead of issuing his orders
from headquarters, was overseeing the details in person.
He never tired.</p>

<p>“I would rather follow him on the war trail,”
continued Micky. “But if he is not here I shall go
with Big Mouth and Nan-ta-je and Lieutenant Bourke,
and you. It will mean fighting. We will find the
Tonto and Yavapai. That I know.”</p>

<p>“How do you know, Micky?” asked Jimmie curiously—for
Micky spoke assuredly.</p>

<p>“I know it from Nan-ta-je. Why he knows I
cannot tell you now, but you will see.” And with that,
the mysterious red-headed Micky became Indian, and
refused to utter another word on the subject.</p>

<p>As far as Jimmie could learn from Joe Felmer and
Jack Long and the talk at the post, the plan for the
campaign was as follows:</p>

<p>The troops and scouts at Camp Apache, under Major
George M. Randall, of the Twenty-third Infantry,
were to work in toward the Tonto Basin from the east.
The Camp Grant column, under Brevet Major W. H.
Brown, were to work up from the south. From the
far northwest, at Camp Hualpai, Colonel Julius W.
Mason (who had roundly threshed the Apache-Mohaves
that had conspired to assassinate General
Crook at Date Creek, last summer) was to march
down with his Fifth Cavalry and some Hualpais.
From Date Creek to the southwest Captain George F.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
Price, of the Fifth Cavalry, should come on; and from
the west the Fort Whipple column, under Major Alexander
MacGregor, of the First Cavalry, and the Camp
Verde First Cavalry under Colonel C. C. C. Carr, and
the Camp McDowell Fifth Cavalry and Pimas and
Maricopas under Captain “Jimmie” Burns, were to
complete the circle.</p>

<p>They all were to clean the country as they advanced,
and close in on the Tonto Basin.</p>

<p>Just before the Camp Grant column started, the
general’s final orders were read to all the soldiers and
scouts, in line. It was to be a fight to a finish. The
Indians who would not surrender must be pursued
until killed or captured. Women and children should
not be harmed, if possible. Prisoners were to be well
treated. Men prisoners should be enlisted as scouts,
when they were willing to serve; and full use should be
made of them, to discover the hiding-places of the other
wild Apaches. And——</p>

<p>“The general commanding the Department wishes
to state that no excuse will be accepted for leaving a
trail. If the horses become unfit for service, the enemy
must be followed on foot. He expects that no sacrifice
shall be left untried by officers and men, to make the
campaign short, sharp and decisive.”</p>

<p>Antonio Besias the interpreter and guide translated
the orders for the Apache scouts. At his first opportunity,
Micky asked Jimmie to repeat them. Nan-ta-je
also listened attentively. He grunted satisfaction.</p>

<p>“That is good,” commented Micky. “It is straight
talk. We will find what we are looking for.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span></p>

<p>The Major Brown column out of Camp Grant consisted
of Companies L and M of the Fifth Cavalry,
commanded by Captain Alfred B. Taylor and Lieutenant
Jacob Almy, Lieutenant (Brevet Major) William
J. Ross, of the Twenty-first Infantry, who had won
honors in the Civil War, and Lieutenant John G.
Bourke, of the Third Cavalry, who had been General
Crook’s aide-de-camp. They were all good fighting
men. Then there were thirty Sierra Blanca Apache
scouts—Chief Big Mouth, Alchisé who was called
Alchisay, Nan-ta-je whom the soldiers nicknamed
“Joe,” Na-kay-do-klun-ni who was nicknamed “Bobby
Do-klinny,” and the others, managed by Joe Felmer,
Archie MacIntosh and Antonio Besias. Then there
was the pack-train of fifty mules, in charge of Pack-Master
Jack Long and Assistant Frank Monach, and
ten such first-class packers as Jim O’Neill, Chileno
John, “Long Jim” Cook and “Short Jim” Cook,
Manuel Lopez, old Sam Wisser the German, with Slim
Shorty as cook and John Cahill as blacksmith—men
tried and true. Then there was Mr. James Daily, General
Crook’s brother-in-law who had come out to Whipple
last spring with his sister Mrs. Crook, and was
“seeing the country” with the cavalry; and Micky
Free, who might be counted as a sort of “detached”
scout.</p>

<p>Altogether, Jimmie felt convinced, this was the best
column in the field. As Patron Jack asserted, it could
“lick its weight in wild-cats.”</p>

<small>HUNTING THE YAVAPAI</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Now Apache catch Apache,” announced Micky.</p>

<p>It was a sharply chill evening, December 27, this
1872, and under a clouded sky the whole Major Brown
command were encamped together in the little canyon
of Cottonwood Creek, about seventy-five miles northwest
of Camp Grant.</p>

<p>Not far west rose the long, high plateau of the
Mazatzal or Four Peaks Range, through which the Salt
River cut a deep, crooked trail toward Camp MacDowell
on the other side.</p>

<p>But the seventy-five miles was only a small portion
of the distance that had been covered. The Major
Brown column out of Grant had been marching north,
west, south, and north again, for more than a month;
sometimes in cactus and sunshine, sometimes in snow
and storm, ever trying to corral the Chuntz and Delt-che
outlaws.</p>

<p>These were hard to find. In this rough canyon
country they had made their homes for years and
years. They knew every inch of it. Only the Sierra
Blanca scouts, who were afoot, in silent moccasins,
and kept a day’s march ahead, had had any luck. Twice
they had struck small rancherias; and they had killed
four or five warriors.</p>

<p>Micky hunted with the scouts, daytimes; and each
night, when in camp, he had great stories to tell. It
all was a lark, to Micky the red-head. He had captured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
a rifle, in one of the Chuntz jacals or huts, and
now was very happy. He seemed rather to pity
Jimmie, who was held to the plodding, scrambling
pack-train, at the rear.</p>

<p>Still, duty was duty, and business was business; and
the pack-train was as important as the soldiers or the
scouts. Without the pack-train, then the expedition
needs must quit or starve—and what would General
Crook say?</p>

<p>On Christmas Day forty men of Company G, Fifth
Cavalry, commanded by Captain “Jimmie” Burns and
Lieutenant Earl D. Thomas, with pack-train and almost
one hundred Pima Indian scouts, all from Camp MacDowell,
had joined.</p>

<p>They’d had some luck. On the top of the Four
Peaks they had surprised a Yavapai rancheria (one of
Delt-che’s, they thought), had killed six Indians and
captured a squaw and a little boy. They had brought
the boy along, because he could kill quail with stones
and with bow and arrow. His new name was “Mike.”</p>

<p>Only Nan-ta-je could understand much that Mike
said. The Yavapai language was different from
straight Apache. And why Nan-ta-je understood
Yavapai, Jimmie presently found out.</p>

<p>This evening of December 27, two days after the
Captain Burns column had been met, something evidently
was up. Patron Jack had received orders from
Major Brown to park his mules in close, along a picket
line, “in a place easy of defence.” That was one hint.</p>

<p>“‘Find heap Injuns, poco tiempo (in little
while),’ those scouts keep sayin’, do they?” grumbled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
Jack. “Humph! Looks like ‘heap Injuns’ might
be goin’ to find <em>us</em>, mebbe!”</p>

<p>And now as Jimmie, having finished his duties for
the evening, made way through the early dusk to look
up Micky and listen to the stories of the scouts, he
noted that Major Brown and the six officers and Chief
Guide Archie MacIntosh were in a group around a
little fire, talking low with one another.</p>

<p>The soldiers, wrapped in their cavalry overcoats,
huddled also, in messes, smoking and joking. They
might have been waiting for the time to roll in their
blankets, but somehow they all seemed to be waiting
for something else.</p>

<p>A little apart from the cavalry camp was the scouts’
camp; Chief Big Mouth’s White Mountains in one
place, the Pimas in another. The Apaches certainly
knew how to make themselves comfortable. They
stuffed their moccasins with dry grass, to keep their
feet warmer, and slept two or three together in snug
beds among the rocks.</p>

<p>This evening they were having an especially good
time. They were roasting and eating pieces of a mule
that had died from poison. Micky was squatting and
tearing at a chunk, like the rest of them, near one of
their little fires.</p>

<p>With greasy mouth he grinned amiably as Jimmie
approached to squat beside him.</p>

<p>“Come and eat, Boy-who-sleeps,” he greeted, in
Apache.</p>

<p>“I have eaten. I am full,” explained Jimmie.
Poisoned mule was rather more than he could stomach,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
although when with the Chiricahuas he had eaten
almost anything.</p>

<p>“It is well to be full,” said Micky, chewing hard.
“We may not eat again for a long time.”</p>

<p>“Why, Red-head?”</p>

<p>“Because,” asserted Micky, changing to Mexican-Spanish,
“now Apache catch Apache. We start soon.
If you want to go, you had better be getting ready.”</p>

<p>“Where are they? How do you know?” demanded
Jimmie.</p>

<p>Micky swallowed a large mouthful of mule meat,
and held his chunk in the coals again, with a sharpened
stick.</p>

<p>“I know,” he said. “Soon all the soldiers will
know, so I will tell you what I could not tell you before.
Cluke knew, when we left Camp Grant. He had talked
with Bocon (which was Spanish for Big Mouth), and
with Nan-ta-je. Major Brown knew, too. But it
has been a secret. We are here to fight Delt-che’s
Yavapai where they have hidden in the Four Peaks
above the Salt River. Nan-ta-je was brought up,
there, when he was a boy. It is a big cave, in the face
of the canyon made by the Salt River. It is reached
by a secret trail from above. Nan-ta-je knows the
trail. He told Bocon and Bocon told the Gray Fox,
and they arranged, at Camp Grant. First we were
to chase Chuntz, who had killed your Francisco. That
has been done, and he has got away. Now we will
follow Nan-ta-je to the cave of the Delt-che people.”</p>

<p>“How far, Micky?” breathlessly asked Jimmie.</p>

<p>Micky proceeded to gnaw his meat chunk, hot
though it was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span></p>

<p>“A night’s march, over the mountains along the
Salt River. We start as soon as a bright star rises
over the hills in the east. The soldiers must leave
their horses, and all wear moccasins, to make no noise,
and must get there before daylight. If we are discovered
on the trail, we will be killed, every one of us.
Nobody can escape, then. That is what Bocon and
Nan-ta-je say, and they know. It will be a fine fight,
anyway. The Yavapai will be in their cave, behind
a rock wall across its mouth, and we will be on a flat
place outside, in front; and those who fall off will land,
in the river, far below. Yes. That is why I came,
to see. You must run off from your pack-mules and
be there, too, Cheemie.”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t run off, but I’ll ask, you bet!” exclaimed
Jimmie, jumping up.</p>

<p>“Inju (good)!” grunted Micky, gulping fast, to
finish his chunk. “You and I will stay with the White
Mountains. They will fight. But I don’t think much
of these Pimas. Whenever one is killed, the rest stop
fighting and make medicine.”</p>

<p>Jimmie hustled back. He was all on fire to go. It
sounded as though it was to be a fight that a fellow
would hate to miss.</p>

<p>A change had come over the camp. The cavalry
detachments were astir. The non-commissioned officers
were passing among the squads, inspecting equipment;
in the glow of the fires the men were donning
moccasins, overhauling their stubby fifty-calibre
Springfield carbines, and stuffing their cartridge-belts,
worn outside their blue overcoats, with the brass cartridges<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
distributed from the green ammunition-boxes
lugged by the pack-train.</p>

<p>The officers’ council had broken up; the captains and
lieutenants were with their companies; Archie MacIntosh
and Joe Felmer strode briskly through, for the
scouts. Jimmie seized upon Joe.</p>

<p>“Joe! Can I go? I want to go!”</p>

<p>“Whar?”</p>

<p>“To see the fight at the cave!”</p>

<p>“What cave? How do you know about any cave?
You must have been with that pesky Micky Free ag’in.
Wall, you keep yore mouth shut about a cave. No, I
don’t say you can go. You aren’t under my orders.
You’re with the pack outfit. Don’t bother me.”</p>

<p>And away hastened Joe, following Archie. Away
hastened Jimmie, likewise, to find Jack Long.</p>

<p>All the cavalry horses had been tied to a picket
rope, near the mules, against the canyon side. The
riggings and the packs were being piled as a breastwork—the
task had been almost completed—old Jack
and Frank Monach and Jim O’Neill and Blacksmith
John Cahill and even Slim Shorty were standing armed
and ready—evidently the packers were to join the
cavalrymen—hurrah, the pack men were to be in the
fight!</p>

<p>“Say, whar you been?” accused Jack. “Now you
stay——”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jack, can I go? I want to go, Jack! Please
can I go?” pleaded Jimmie.</p>

<p>“Seems to me you’re alluz wantin’ to ‘go’
some’ers,” growled Jack. “You ask Joe Felmer.
He’s yore gardeen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span></p>

<p>“I did ask him and he said I wasn’t with him, I
was with the pack outfit; and the pack outfit’s going,
isn’t it?” argued Jimmie.</p>

<p>“Best part of it,” admitted Jack. “Orders from
the major are for every able-bodied man to march out,
an’ for those who can’t climb to guard the animals an’
packs, hyar. Dunno which’ll be the dangerouser place,
in case the Injuns try a stampede.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let him go; he’s earned it, I reckon,” spoke
up “Long Jim” Cook gruffly. “He can stick beside
o’ me. (Long Jim being six feet eight!) Then all
the bullets’ll fly so high he won’t even feel the wind
of ’em.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be up in front with Micky Free. Micky and
I can scout as well as any Apache,” panted Jimmie.
“We won’t be hurt.” He turned, to make off again,
but Jack sternly halted him.</p>

<p>“You do as the rest do, then: put on a blanket-roll
an’ stick in some grub, an’ change yore feet into
moccasins.”</p>

<p>That took only a few moments, for a boy in a hurry.
Slim Shorty the cook good-naturedly supplied the moccasins;
the blanket-roll was made up in a jiffy, around
a wad of bread and cold meat, and was slung over
Jimmie’s left shoulder——</p>

<p>“If ’twasn’t Micky Free I wouldn’t let you go,”
warned Jack. “But nothin’ yet invented can harm
<em>him</em>, so if you jest hang onto his shirt-tail he’ll take
you through!”</p>

<p>This time Jimmie got away, but none too soon, for
the soldier column was forming, to low commands.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
The fires had died down, darkness had closed in, and
he scurried fast, through the gloom. The scouts were
bunched—Apaches together, and Pimas together—standing,
wrapped in their blankets, waiting. Beyond
them, somebody struck a match. The flame lighted
the face of Nan-ta-je and of Major Brown, who was
looking at his watch.</p>

<p>Jimmie, pausing and peering, felt a hand on his
arm and heard Micky’s voice, under breath. Micky
could see in the dark.</p>

<p>“Inju. Star nearly up. Before sun is up, big
fight.”</p>

<p>Nan-ta-je’s star must have appeared at that very
moment, for Major Brown struck another match, to
show his hand raised as signal, he and Nan-ta-je moved
forward, the scouts moved, pressing in the wake of
Archie MacIntosh, and Joe, and Tony Besias, there
were gruff orders, half whispers, from the sergeants,
to the soldiers; and amidst soft shuffle of moccasins
the whole long column followed the lead of the major
and Nan-ta-je, presently up out of the little canyon,
for the high mesa or table-land above.</p>

<p>Whew, but the December night was growing cold!
The clouds had broken, the stars were very bright,
faintly illumining the dark winding column, and the
frosty breaths wafting from it. Scarce a sound, except
the scuff of the moccasins, could be heard. The
United States cavalry in Arizona did not carry sabers
when scouting for Apaches; and to-night even the canteens
had been stowed in the blanket rolls, lest they
jingle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span></p>

<p>According to the north star the course was westerly.
Nan-ta-je and the major led at a rapid pace, to
keep the men warm. Jimmie stuck close by Micky.
He had no fear of not being able to hold his own.
He trotted loose-kneed, toeing in, head up, breathing
through his nose, Apache way.</p>

<p>Trudge, trudge, scuff, scuff, hour after hour, as
seemed, westward across the high, rough mesa where
the snow lay in patches and the Four Peaks of the
Mazatzal rose close on the right. To the left was
the canyon of the Salt River.</p>

<p>The Apache scouts forged ahead of the cavalry.
Along after midnight, from a little rise sign was seen
away off, before. Lights! Major Brown and Nan-ta-je
had halted.</p>

<p>“Come! Quick!” hissed Micky, he and Jimmie
trotting faster. “Camp-fires. Maybe Yavapai.”</p>

<p>“Column, halt! Lie down, men,” sounded the
low gruff order, behind.</p>

<p>Down flopped everybody, except Archie MacIntosh
and Joe Felmer, and half a dozen of the scouts with
them, who continued on rapidly. Micky slipped after,
like a shadow; he did not intend to miss anything.</p>

<p>Jimmie had dropped in the van of the other scouts,
near to the major and Nan-ta-je. They and Chief
Big Mouth and Bobby Do-klinny were crouched under
a blanket.</p>

<p>“Nan-ta-je step in track. Think it man track,”
grunted, in Apache, the Indian beside Jimmie. Queer
how the Apaches seemed to know everything! And
Nan-ta-je had merely felt the track, through his moccasin
sole!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span></p>

<p>Under the blanket the major—or somebody—struck
another match. Just the faint crackle told. The little
group examined the track, there was short muttering;
then the crouchers relaxed and quit, and waited. Big
Mouth crept back.</p>

<p>“Shosh (Bear),” he informed.</p>

<p>Nan-ta-je had been fooled, but a bear track is very
much like a moccasin track.</p>

<p>Nobody spoke again. If anyone even coughed,
from the cold air, he did so with his mouth pressed
against his blanket. Jimmie shivered with the cold
and the excitement.</p>

<p>Now here came Archie and Joe and their squad,
trotting back from their reconnoitering. Archie reported
to Major Brown and Nan-ta-je.</p>

<p>“Yavapai fires,” whispered Micky, sinking beside
Jimmie. “Pony herd, too. Four wickyups. No
Yavapai. Left wickyups and ponies, little while ago.
Maybe go to tell Delt-che.”</p>

<p>That looked bad.</p>

<p>“Huh!” grunted a White Mountain. “We go to
surprise Yavapai. If Yavapai know and surprise us,
we all get killed, says Nan-ta-je.”</p>

<p>“What ponies?” asked somebody, of Micky.</p>

<p>“Pima and undah (white-man) ponies. Traveled
far. Feet worn out.”</p>

<p>In their cavalry capes Captain Taylor and Lieutenant
Bourke stole forward, stooping. They had been
sent for to consult with Major Brown, Archie MacIntosh,
and Nan-ta-je and Chief Big Mouth. Pretty
soon they went back. The march was resumed, toward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
the fires. The column had spread out, ready to defend
itself, but the White Mountain scouts kept ahead.
Chief Owl Ears’ Pimas were behind with the Captain
Burns company.</p>

<p>The fires were still glowing at the Yavapai camp
on the top of the mesa, in a hollow where there were
grass and water for the stolen ponies. But save for
the snorts of the ponies, all was silence. The march
had been made cautiously, and now the air had thinned;
in the east the sky had lightened. Morning was at
hand.</p>

<p>“Yavapai cave near,” whispered Micky. The
word had been passed along, somehow. The march
was halted again. Teeth chattered.</p>

<p>Next, Lieutenant Ross continued, with Archie and
Joe and Nan-ta-je, a dozen cavalrymen and the packers
Jack Long, Jim O’Neill, Long Jim Cook, Frank Monach,
Slim Shorty—dead shots all, and fine Indian fighters.
Nan-ta-je led.</p>

<p>Captain Burns and Lieutenant Thomas, with their
cavalrymen and most of the Pimas, branched off on
the back trail of the pony herd, to the southeast. More
Yavapai might be coming, from that direction, with
other booty.</p>

<p>The remainder of the column followed Lieutenant
Ross. The White Mountains had dropped their
blankets about their waists, as if clearing for action.
Their faces were set alert, their nostrils flared, they
were straining every sense, to detect more “sign.”
Micky pointed downward; underfoot was a regular
trail, disclosed in the gray light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span></p>

<p>Their carbines and rifles at a trail, the Lieutenant
Ross detachment, led by Nan-ta-je, with Archie and
Joe at his heels, had dipped out of sight, as if over an
edge. The last one of them disappeared. The faint
roar of rapid waters sounded.</p>

<p>“Canyon of Salt River there,” whispered Micky.
“Yavapai cave, too.”</p>

<p>The crack of the canyon began to open—across
were the opposite walls. Cold mist was floating up.
The trail conducted to the canyon, and down. Major
Brown and Captain Taylor and Lieutenant Bourke,
with Tony Besias the interpreter, Chief Big Mouth
and others went forward to peer in. As the column
bunched, everybody tried to peer in. Micky craned
forward, with the scouts—he and Alchisé and Bobby
Do-klinny; Jimmie edged on; they all might look over
the rim, for the officers were as curious as the rest.</p>

<p>The roar of the waters rose louder. The river was
far down, hundreds of feet, at the bottom of a long
crooked gorge with precipice walls. Icicles hung from
the crags. The trail entered, here, and clinging to
the niches and wearing away the sod of the few flat
spots snaked at a diagonal until, descending, it rounded
a shoulder one hundred yards below the rim, where
the mists were wreathing.</p>

<p>It was as steep as the trail down which those Tontos
had scampered, into the Tonto Basin! Nobody was on
it. The Ross party had gone.</p>

<p>“Mescal,” whispered Micky, sniffing. All the
scouts were sniffing. A sweetish scent was in the air,
as if welling from below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span></p>

<p>Apache mescal pits! Wood smoke, too! Smell it?</p>

<p>“Huh! Rancheria there,” grunted Bobby
Do-klinny. “Close to Delt-che, now. Where
Nan-ta-je?”</p>

<p>Then——</p>

<p>“Bang-g-g-g-g-g!”</p>

<p>The noise, echoing through the canyon depths and
striking the faces gazing in, fairly deafened. It
sounded like a regiment, but it was only a volley by the
Lieutenant Ross party, unseen.</p>

<p>The little handful of advance guard had found the
Yavapai!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XIV">XIV<br />
<small>THE BATTLE OF THE CAVE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The suddenness of the tremendous outburst
paralyzed even Micky. As the echoes rumbled and
jarred, Jimmie’s heart beat in his ears. The hard,
quick voice of Major Brown broke in.</p>

<p>“Good heavens! What’s all that? Bourke, take
the first forty men—doesn’t matter who—support Ross
as quick as you can, and wait for the rest of the command.
I’ll join you in short order. Hold your fire, if
possible, till I arrive. Tell Ross the same.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” and the strong, active figure of Lieutenant
Bourke sprang to the trail. “Sergeant Turpin!
Here!” Top Sergeant James Turpin was the nearest
to him. “Count off forty men, as they come, white
or red, and follow me. Quick, now!”</p>

<p>Chief Big Mouth yelped at his men in Apache;
tossed away his blanket.</p>

<p>“Soldier-captain want men to fight Yavapai. Don’t
let white men beat you!”</p>

<p>There was a rush for the trail. Soldiers and Indians
both were eager. Sergeant Turpin had hard
work. Jimmie saw no chance——</p>

<p>“Sh! Come!” hissed Micky, at him.</p>

<p>Micky had slipped over the edge. Only his red
head could be seen. His feet were on a narrow ledge
that, extending along, just held him. Below, the canyon
wall of stunted brush and rough gray rock and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
frozen trickles fell sharply away, clear down to the
cold river, a thousand feet! It was a dizzy sight.</p>

<p>Clutching his rifle, planted as a brace to steady him
while he half kneeled, Micky twisted enough to beckon
with his free hand.</p>

<p>“Come on. Leave your blanket.”</p>

<p>Micky’s blanket lay where he had peeled it. Without
a thought of hesitation Jimmie doffed his own roll,
and squirming flat fumbled, feet first, for the ledge;
found it, and carefully lowered his body, backward.
Ticklish work, that was, for a fellow in a hurry—although
Micky apparently had done it as nimbly as a
squirrel.</p>

<p>“Inju!” approved Micky, when Jimmie was safely
settled. “Now wait.”</p>

<p>If anybody above had noticed, nobody took time to
object. What with the soldiers and scouts so eager
to pass Sergeant Turpin’s count, and what with the
rear guard hastening up, and what with everybody preparing
weapons and clothing and re-forming for the
prospective fight, there were few thoughts upon the
whereabouts of two such items as wild Micky Free
and his partner Jimmie Dunn. Micky was the kind
who usually got a front seat.</p>

<p>Now they too crouched here out of sight upon the
narrow shelf. Scarcely yet had the echoes of the
thunderous volley died away. Listen! Shrill, distant
whoops and yells of defiance, also from below! But
there sounded a brisk command, above—the fast shuffle
of feet and the rolling of pebbles—and down the slanting
trail that cut along the sheer wall plunged, sliding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
and striding, the support company, Lieutenant Bourke
first, Chief Big Mouth next, and their file of men, white
and red mingled in a fast jumble, close pursuing, every
carbine and rifle ready for business.</p>

<p>Micky poised, crouching tense. Just as the tail
of the little procession swung past, slipping and steadying
again he darted forward on the shelf. Jimmie
imitated. They scuttled so fast that they either must
keep going or tumble off. The shelf pinched out before
it cut the trail, but Micky never paused; he leaped, and
landed like a goat, on a smaller shelf, a mere piece of
out-sticking rock; that gave him purchase for another
leap which took him to the trail; and turning instantly
he ran down.</p>

<p>Jimmie had no time for thought. What Micky
could do, he could do—he <em>had to</em>! He, too, leaped;
barely touched the next rock with one moccasin; sprang
on, desperately, across space, brushing the wall; landed
on the edge of the trail, slipped, recovered (Whew!),
and gaining balance sped after Micky.</p>

<p>The trail descended, narrow and broken and icy in
spots, at a steep angle. Anybody who lost his footing
on it would be a “goner”—he’d not stop until, having
bounced and rolled and hurtled, he was a fragment of
shattered bone and flesh in the roaring river below.
It was a regular Apache trail.</p>

<p>But Micky was running. The Lieutenant Bourke
file were at a trot, and already half-way to the turn
around the shoulder. So Jimmie ran.</p>

<p>Micky caught the tail of the file before it rounded
the shoulder, and slackened to keep pace with it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
Jimmie caught Micky just as the tail, who was John
Cahill the blacksmith, was disappearing like the lash
end of a dragged whip—but he did not go much
farther.</p>

<p>The file were scattering like frightened quail, to a
chorus of Apache yells, and the clatter and swish of
arrows, and a rapidly barked command. Micky dived
for the shelter of a jagged boulder, and Jimmie followed
suit. They all had arrived.</p>

<p>It was a broad shelf two hundred yards long, about
half-way between the bottom of the precipice and the
top, and littered with boulders. On right and left,
behind the boulders, were the Ross men, their carbine
barrels pointing steadily at a high rock wall about in
the middle of the shelf, a little way out from the face
of the precipice. Behind this rock wall—which was ten
feet high and built up smooth—was a large opening:
the Yavapai cave!</p>

<p>All the air resounded with whoops and screeches,
and bow twang, and now and then a gun-shot, coming
from the cave. The Yavapais were inside. Several
might be glimpsed, between the end of the rock wall
and the mouth of the cave, darting about. They
dragged a body or two back, out of sight. The Ross
volley had killed some of them.</p>

<p>“Big fight!” panted Micky. “Good. We are in
time.”</p>

<p>“Hey! What in thunder are you doin’ down
hyar?” scolded Joe Felmer, from behind the next
boulder—he and John Cahill together. “You want to
lose yore scalps?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span></p>

<p>Micky only grinned impudently, and with an Apache
yell answered the Yavapais. The White Mountains
were replying with taunt to taunt. Jimmie said not a
word. He may have done wrong, but here he was.</p>

<p>“Wall, you stay mighty close,” ordered Joe.
“This’ll be no picnic.”</p>

<p>“What have you done, Black Beard?” called Chief
Big Mouth, who was near.</p>

<p>“The pony thieves were dancing their deeds in the
mouth of the cave. Before they saw us we killed six
of them.”</p>

<p>“Bueno,” grunted the fierce Big Mouth.</p>

<p>Lying low, Lieutenant Ross and Lieutenant Bourke
and Nan-ta-je were consulting together. Presently
orders were passed from man to man, on this side; and
by ones and twos and threes the soldiers and scouts
spread out, in the gray dawn, selecting other positions
here, or bending, went scurrying across, against the
shelter of the cave rampart, to reinforce the other flank,
while the carbines of their fellows kept the Yavapais
from shooting at them.</p>

<p>Listen, again! Amidst the cries of the enraged
Yavapais there rose the clink of carbine butt and shuffle
of moccasins from marching men, again. Major
Brown was bringing down the rest of the troops. But
Micky had focussed his attention upon something else.
The roving one eye of his never missed a single point.</p>

<p>“Yavapai!” he uttered excitedly, half rising and
pointing, and up he jerked his rifle.</p>

<p>“Hooh!” exclaimed Big Mouth, craning.</p>

<p>John Cahill was the quickest. Away beyond, down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
the beetling canyon wall, on an out-jutting rock there,
stood a naked Indian with long black hair. He
whooped triumphantly. He had escaped, somehow,
from the cave—he was almost to the bottom and in a
moment more——</p>

<p>“Bang!”</p>

<p>Blacksmith Cahill’s carbine had spoken even while
Big Mouth and Joe and Micky were taking aim.</p>

<p>“Thut!” That was the bullet striking flesh. Off
from the rock was swept the Indian, and disappeared.
Whether or not he had been killed, nobody knew; but
his body was found later, by some squaws.</p>

<p>“He will take no word to other Yavapai, I think,”
pronounced Micky. “If other Yavapai come and
catch us here, then we are dead, too.”</p>

<p>The Major Brown soldiers were pelting in, breathless
from the slippery trail. Hither-thither they deployed,
sneaking among the rocks and darting across
the face of the cave-mouth wall. Now a Pima of the
Bourke men stood up, daring the Yavapais while he
peered for a shot into the cave. A puff of smoke
belched from a niche atop the rampart—“Bang!”—and
down he wilted, into a crumpled heap without
motion.</p>

<p>The Yavapais yelled louder—their “kill” yell.
The Pimas and White Mountains yelled back.
The soldiers were not doing much shooting, yet. Their
officers were arranging them. Very soon the arrangement
had settled into this:</p>

<p>There was one line of crouching scouts and soldiers
behind the many boulders (which sometimes touched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
one another) not far in front of the cave-mouth wall
and on either flank as the ends curved in. These were
skirmishers. Back of them, clear along the edge of
the immensely broad shelf and extending around the
ends of the shelf, and even among the crags of the
precipice, was a second line, in reserve, also behind
rocks, to cover the first line. Some of the rocks were
low, some high; they formed all kinds of shelter, from
which one might shoot over and around corners and
through chinks. The Micky-Jimmie boulder, down
from the foot of the trail, in the second line, was about
the size of a roll-top office-desk; and squatting they
might peep across the ragged surface of it and see the
whole length of the big shelf.</p>

<p>From either side Joe Felmer and Big Mouth wriggled
in toward them, to shoot between their rocks and
this.</p>

<p>“Steady! Hold your fire till orders,” warned
Sergeant Turpin and others.</p>

<p>For Antonio Besias the interpreter was speaking.
He half rose, from along the second line, and called
in Apache.</p>

<p>“You must all come out!” he shouted. “The
soldier-captain has many men and many guns. He has
found you, and you cannot get away. He does not
wish to kill you, but he will kill you unless you lay
down your guns and come out.”</p>

<p>Back behind his rock ducked Antonio, just in time
to dodge a dozen arrows, not to say several bullets.
What a storm of hoots and shrieks had drowned his
voice!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span></p>

<p>“We are not afraid!” were retorting the cave warriors.
“Yah yah! We are not afraid,” they jeered,
in Apache and Spanish. “It is you who will die, you
white men and you traitor moccasin-stealers who rob
women.” To accuse an Apache of stealing moccasins
from squaws was the bitterest of insults. “You will
not live to see the sun rise. Our people are coming
up from below, and you will be fed to the buzzards.
Yah!”</p>

<p>Nan-ta-je tried, in Apache and Mohave jargon both.
But he, too, had to duck, before he had finished telling
them to send out their women and children, anyway.</p>

<p>“We are not fighting those,” he said. “We fight
only men. The soldier-captain will wait until you
send out your women and children. They will not be
harmed. It is not right——” and his words were lost
in another burst of furious, insolent clamor.</p>

<p>Major Brown’s trumpeter orderly sounded: “Commence
firing.” The high strains lilted gaily from canyon
wall to canyon wall, and back again.</p>

<p>“Take it easy, boys,” cautioned Sergeant Turpin,
near the Jimmy squad. “Let the front line do the
work, but if you see a head, hit it. But watch out for
the women and children.”</p>

<p>The Yavapai warriors, behind their high rock
rampart, taller than they were, had difficulty in seeing
out. Occasionally a head seemed to be cautiously
poked up, under an old hat, and the men of the front
rank promptly banged away at it.</p>

<p>Micky, squirming for a rest, leveled his battered
rifle across the top of the boulder, took aim with his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
one eye—“Bang!” Instantly an answering shot so
shrewdly scraped the boulder top that the stinging rock
splinters filled not only Micky’s one eye but both eyes
of the intently peering Jimmie.</p>

<p>“Fool Red-head, you; why you shoot?” scolded
Big Mouth. “Squaw hold up hat on stick, you shoot
at that, man shoot at <em>you</em>!”</p>

<p>This trick did not deceive the soldiers long. The
Yavapais quit it, and from behind their wall began to
send arrows by scores high into the air, so that, curving
downward, they might land among the rocks where
the soldiers and scouts lay.</p>

<p>Major Brown met this with a similar scheme.
Nan-ta-je and Archie MacIntosh wriggled forward, as
rapidly as snakes, among the rocks, from back line to
front line, taking a message to soldiers and scouts.
The word was passed, for suddenly all the line elevated
the carbines and rifles a little higher and shot fast.</p>

<p>Long Jim Cook and Alchisé and Lieutenant Ross
and the others in sight were grabbing the cartridges
spread by the handful beside them, and using them as
rapidly as triggers might be pulled. From the whole
wide cave floated dust; here and there the edges melted
away.</p>

<p>“Hi! That’s the stuff!” muttered Joe. “Shoot
into the cave an’ let the bullets glance. That’ll fetch
’em.”</p>

<p>Now squaws and children were crying with pain
and fright. The glancing, re-bounding bullets favored
nobody. The warriors howled furiously. The lead
was finding them, behind their wall. Worse, it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
wounding their wives and babies. So they stood up,
to face it and try to divert it—stop it, if possible.</p>

<p>Their scowling faces and naked or ragged-shirted
shoulders might be seen, above the breastworks, amidst
the smoke and dust. They, too, shot rapidly, point-blank,
into the rocks before—and the squaws’ and children’s
arms were glimpsed, handing up to them loaded
guns.</p>

<p>At the far end of the wall was a strange, wild figure—their
medicine man! Yes, because he wore a large
head-dress of painted feathers and a painted, beaded
buckskin shirt hung with strings and shells, which
should protect him and his people from the bullets.
He was fighting, too!</p>

<p>Twice Joe Felmer drew bead on him and shot; only
to mutter:</p>

<p>“I can’t tech that feller.”</p>

<p>“No. He is big medicine,” reproved Chief Bocon.
“You had better save your bullets, Black Beard.”</p>

<p>“Cease firing!” shrilled the bugle. And on a sudden
there was nothing doing, and almost a complete
silence, except for crying children, until Antonio Besias
called again, in Spanish.</p>

<p>“You have fought well, but you can see that you
have no chance. The soldier-captain says for you to
come out. Or if you are so foolish as not to come out,
send to us your women and children, that they may
not be hurt.”</p>

<p>The Yavapais did not answer. They had disappeared
from the wall. Maybe they were consulting
together, about the peace summons. Everybody waited<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
expectantly. Jimmie, trembling with the excitement
and the horror of the fight, hoped that the people in
the cave would now surrender.</p>

<p>Ah, what was that? More defiance? The Yavapais
were chanting—a high, wild chorus, men and
squaws both—and the shuffle and thud of a dance could
be heard.</p>

<p>“Hooh! They make ready to charge,” grunted
Chief Big Mouth. “They sing their death song. We
must shoot straight, Black Beard.”</p>

<p>“Look out! It is the death song! They will
charge!” were warning Nan-ta-je, Bobby Do-klinny,
Alchisé, and the other scouts, in Apache and Spanish;
and the soldiers repeated.</p>

<p>“Good!” pronounced Micky, his blue eye snapping.
“It will be a fight man to man. That is no
fun, to shoot into a cave.”</p>

<p>The chant welled higher and stronger, and all the
canyon echoed again. Would they never come?</p>

<p>The front or skirmish line had shifted to their
knees, guns at shoulders—Lieutenant Ross had drawn
his revolver.</p>

<p>“Steady, lads,” was cautioning Sergeant Turpin
and his non-coms, to this rear line. “Hold your
places.”</p>

<p>“Here they come!”</p>

<p>A great cheer rang, for like jacks-in-the-box the
Yavapai warriors had appeared—some twenty or thirty
of them—all together leaping atop their rampart—strong,
muscular, bronze-skinned fighters, bristling
quivers of reed arrows upon their left shoulders, strung<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
bows in one hand, rifles in the other, their eyes gleaming
blackly, their raven hair flung back, their painted
faces scowling. They emptied their guns in a crashing
volley, and proceeded to ply their bows while the squaws
handed up fresh guns. The skirmish line of scouts
and soldiers swept the wall—the smoke eddied and
hung—and out from the farther end of the wall bolted
a little bevy of other warriors, to break through for
freedom.</p>

<p>Up from their rocks jumped the skirmish line, and
ran to head them off. Long Jim Cook, Alchisé, Bobby
Do-klinny, Nan-ta-je, Slim Shorty, Lieutenant Ross,
with his revolver—they all ran, shooting and yelling.</p>

<p>They were too many for the Yavapais. The top
of the wall had been cleaned—and back through the
opening at the end hustled, pell-mell, the escaping warriors,
dragging cripples, but leaving, in the open space
there, half a dozen crimsoned, motionless forms.</p>

<p>The firing died away. The face of the cave precipice
was beginning to glow with sunlight. What next,
now?</p>

<p>“Yavapai!” yelped Micky, springing up.</p>

<p>“Hooh!” exclaimed Big Mouth.</p>

<p>Micky had leveled his rifle—it missed fire. Now
twenty paces before their rock was standing, on another
rock, a tall Apache-Mohave. How he had
sneaked this far, nobody might say. He must have
run out from the near end of the rampart, while everybody
was watching the far end. The smoke was very
thick.</p>

<p>He did not know that there were two lines of enemy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
and he had paused a moment to whoop his triumph at
having passed the first line. How foolish! In a
twinkle a score of carbines and rifles were focussed on
him—John Cahill aimed, Joe Felmer aimed, Big
Mouth aimed—they could not miss.</p>

<p>He was a fine, brave warrior—and he saw, too late.</p>

<p>“Soldados (Soldiers)!” he shrieked.</p>

<p>“Crash!” The guns all shot together; the bullets
fairly lifted him and drove him topsy-turvy, riddled
through and through from head to waist.</p>

<p>“Crowed a leetle soon, that feller,” commented Joe.</p>

<small>JIMMIE IS A VETERAN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The December sun was high and warm, flooding
the broad rock-strewn terrace half-way between river
and sky, but the battle was still going on. Now that
the Yavapais had found out they could not break to
freedom, the second soldier line had been advanced,
with a dash, to join the first. As fast as it could
be loaded and fired, every gun was speeding bullet
after bullet into the cave, filling it with a very hailstorm
of glancing, crisscrossing lead.</p>

<p>The cave was broad, and seemed to be shallow; and
how anybody in there could be alive was a mystery.
But alive some of those Apache-Mohaves were, for
above the deafening staccato of a hundred carbines
rose the death chant and the shrieks and wails and
groans and curses.</p>

<p>There was no token of surrender. It was a fight
to the death. Cleverly shielded in a niche at his end
of the rampart the medicine-man, barely seen through
the smoke and dust, was shooting as before, helped by
the squaws who handed up guns to him; he certainly
wore a charmed shirt. Now and again a warrior
bobbed up, fired blindly, and bobbed down.</p>

<p>Micky had long ago used the last of his cartridges.
Like Jimmie, he might only lie and watch.</p>

<p>“I told you there would be a good fight!” he
shouted, in Jimmie’s ear. “This is the end of these
Delt-che people. They fight like wolves in a pen, but
it is no use.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span></p>

<p>“Look!” shouted back Jimmie, pointing.</p>

<p>An Apache-Mohave boy—he was naked and chubby
and could not have been more than three or four years
old—had run out, around the cave wall, into the open
space in front; and there he stood, sucking his thumb,
and scowling at the Americanos as if he wanted the
noise stopped. Over he keeled, struck by a chance bullet
(for nobody would have shot at <em>him</em>); but he was
not dead—he lay and kicked and howled, and all the
firing ceased as if by magic.</p>

<p>From the soldiers’ line somebody darted forward.
<a href="#i_179">Hurrah!</a></p>

<p><a href="#i_179">It was Nan-ta-je.</a> He reached the little boy,
grabbed him and at one jump was behind a rock again.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_179">
  <img src="images/i_179.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_179">HURRAH! IT WAS NAN-TA-JE</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“Hurrah for Joe! Bully for Joe!” Even the
Yavapais might have cheered—but Nan-ta-je had been
just in time. Scarcely had the uproar of banging guns
and howling warriors and shrieking squaws and wailing
children been renewed, when down from above rushed
a tremendous boulder, bursting like a bomb-shell upon
the wall itself.</p>

<p>“Hooh!” ejaculated Micky, astonished.</p>

<p>The firing slackened, everybody outside looked up.
On the very top of the canyon, right over the cave
mouth, were many figures—soldiers—and Indians!
Outlined against the sky, they appeared curiously small.</p>

<p>“By the great horn spoon, thar’s Burns!” exclaimed
Joe Felmer.</p>

<p>Surely! Jimmie had forgotten about the Captain
Burns and Lieutenant Thomas company, but here they
were, soldiers and Pimas, crowding the rim of the cliff,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
and gazing over as far as they dared. They had returned
from following the pony trail, and had heard
the shooting. Several of the soldiers were hanging
part way—waist far, that is—from the edge, and held
in place by other soldiers behind them were aiming
their revolvers. The cliff slanted back, above the cave,
so that persons above might see its threshold, and the
rampart before—and, of course, see the warriors
between the two.</p>

<p>But that rock! Here came another! Watch out—soldiers
had rolled a second great boulder to the rim—they
gave it a final shove, and bounding, ploughing,
hurtling, it brought an avalanche down the face of the
precipice and landing truly in the mouth of the cave
burst thunderously into a hundred pieces.</p>

<p>A third boulder followed immediately. Then two
at once. The soldiers and scouts below were cheering
and shouting and shooting again, but the crashing of
the boulders was louder. The dust they made was
denser than the powder smoke—the mouth of the cave
could not be seen. But somewhere in that veil were
the wretched Yavapais. Jimmie felt sick.</p>

<p>Even the death chant had ceased, across there.
Anyway, it could not be heard amidst the other uproar.
The Captain Burns men worked hard. The rampart
was being crushed and buried. The Major Brown men
were standing up while they fired; they were so excited.
Jimmie and Micky were standing.</p>

<p>“Down, down with you!” bawled sergeant and corporal.
“Wait till the chargin’ order!”</p>

<p>The fight continued, but it was becoming a very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
one-sided fight. Bombarded by the rock artillery from
above, and by the carbines from in front, and held by
the cave wall behind, the Apache-Mohaves were being
literally wiped out of existence. They were replying
not at all; their brave medicine-man had disappeared
amidst the murk—the occasional rifts showed him no
longer.</p>

<p>Still, it was dangerous, here in front of the cave,
for the bursting boulders, piling up in the entrance and
shattering the rampart there, sent their fragments flying
like pieces of shell, causing the soldiers to duck and
laugh as they plied their cartridges.</p>

<p>Now the trumpet sounded—“Cease firing!” The
shots died away as Major Brown, standing, waved his
arm at the Captain Burns company, on the rim of the
precipice over the cave, to signal them to stop rolling
down their boulders.</p>

<p>“Prepare to charge!” the orders were repeated,
along the line below. The sun was high, marking noon.
The battle had been going on for at least five hours!</p>

<p>“Prepare to charge!” Up sprang the line, and
at the instant down bounded the last of the boulders,
which the officers above had been unable to withhold.
It gave one final tremendous jump, and landed well out
in front of the cave—“Boom!” Something struck
Jimmie—yes, a piece of it caught him as he blindly
dodged—and whirling him around knocked him head
over heels.</p>

<p>He tried to pick himself up, and a fierce pain stabbed
him in the right leg, making him dizzy. He propped
on one arm, among the rocks, while his eyes cleared a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
little. Already the line was running and scrambling
forward, soldiers and scouts both; nobody now might
pause to tend to <em>him</em>. He stared, blinking weakly.
What would happen? Were the Yavapais away back
in the cave, somewhere, and where they were waiting, to
defend it?</p>

<p>There was Micky, scooting about; and Nan-ta-je,
and Joe, and Jack Long, and Captain Taylor and Lieutenant
Bourke, their carbines and revolvers poised, as
they advanced at double-quick. Right up to the top of
the huge pile of shattered rocks climbed the first man—Corporal
Thomas Hanlon, he—and glared in; jumped
down, out of sight, and over and around poured the
others. But not a shot was fired. Evidently all the
Yavapais were dead. Oh!</p>

<p>With that, Jimmie sighed, everything swam before
him, and he must have fainted, because the next that
he knew, Joe Felmer was sopping his face from a canteen,
and Micky was squatting beside, grinning.</p>

<p>From the cave sounded the hum of voices; the soldiers
and scouts were still busy there. The Burns
soldiers and Pimas had come down.</p>

<p>“Hyar! You lie quiet,” ordered Joe. “You got
a busted leg, I reckon, an’ you don’t want to see inside
that cave, anyhow. Wish I hadn’t, myself.”</p>

<p>“Are they all dead, Joe?” quavered Jimmie, helplessly.
Wow, how that leg hurt! But it had been
bound up, after a fashion, probably by Joe.</p>

<p>“Ev’ry buck, includin’ the medicine man. Plumb
shot through, or smashed; lots of ’em both. Some
squaws an’ kids left,” grunted Joe. “It’s what you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
might call a massacree. Now, you stay hyar, till we’re
ready to move ye. I’m needed yonder. Micky can
nuss ye; both o’ ye ought to be back with the pack-train—’tain’t
no place for boys—’speshully for one
who can’t dodge rocks.”</p>

<p>Muttering, Joe (who really was kind-hearted)
trudged away.</p>

<p>“Ah, I told you it would be a great fight, Boy-who-sleeps,”
grinned Micky Free, as he squatted. “Black
Beard is angry, because you are the only one of us
wounded; but you will be a warrior, now.”</p>

<p>“Were you in the cave, Red-head?” asked Jimmie,
also in Apache.</p>

<p>“Yes. It is very red. All the Yavapai warriors
are dead. The medicine chief is dead, under a rock.
One old man was partly alive, and he died soon. Some
squaws and children hid behind large flat rocks, and
under dead people. They will be captives. You will
see them. Delt-che is not there; but he has lost his
best warriors, and he never will make a good fight
again. I am glad we came, Cheemie.”</p>

<p>“What are the Pimas doing, Red-head?” asked
Jimmie. For the Pimas, with Chief Owl Ears in the
center, were sitting in a bunch and wailing.</p>

<p>“Oh, those Pimas!” scoffed Micky. “They make
medicine. They no good any more. They find their
Pima who was killed, and now their medicine tells
them they must not fight again till after they have
mourned him by singing and bathing and not eating.
That will take several days. But Apaches wait till they
get home. I do not think much of the foolish Pimas.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
And the Maricopas are the same. All no good—stop
fighting and make medicine. Huh!”</p>

<p>The soldiers and scouts worked fast, cleaning out
the cave. The squaws and children were placed under
guard, the White Mountains and Pimas were given
whatever stuff—mescal, dried meat, skins, bows,
arrows, lances, guns, and so forth—that they could
carry; the remaining supplies (a great quantity) were
piled up and set on fire.</p>

<p>Joe and Slim Shorty the cook came hurrying back,
with a litter contrived from two lances and a deer hide
slung between.</p>

<p>“Got to get out o’ this place,” explained Joe.
“Squaw says some other squaws went down below, jest
before the fight, to the mescal pits; they’ll carry warnin’
to ’nother rancheria yonder an’ we’ll have the hull
caboodle on our backs if we don’t act fast. Easy, now,
while we put you in.”</p>

<p>Major Brown was in a hurry to climb up into the
open and unite with the pack-train. The long column
ascended the winding trail. There were eighteen captives—women
and children, several of them wounded.
Below, in front of the cave the fire burned fiercely,
consuming the supplies and the many bodies heaped
upon. Over seventy of the outlaws had been killed.
Some were left where they had fallen, in the cave.</p>

<p>After this no Indian would venture inside that cave.
The skeletons of the Delt-che people bleached, undisturbed
for years.</p>

<small>THE GENERAL PLANS WELL</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The campaign against the outlaw Yavapais, Tontos
and Apache-Yumas was by no means over, merely
on account of the cave fight. But it was over, for
Jimmie.</p>

<p>Out went the troops and White Mountain scouts,
again, this time from Camp MacDowell. Jack Long
came into the hospital there, just before the start, and
bade Jimmie good-by.</p>

<p>“You’ll be a fust-class packer yet, muchacho,”
encouraged old Jack. “Yessir; ’bout one more trip an’
I’ll promote ye. You might ask the doctor to stretch
yore legs a trifle, while he has you in hand. Some day
you’re liable to be a reg’lar patron, but that’ll be after
my day. I’ve a notion I’m due to peter out, what with
these hyar up-hill, down-hill, blow hot, blow cold meanderin’s,
chasin’ ’Paches with pack-mules.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you feeling well, Jack?”</p>

<p>“Not extra pert, son. Yuh see, I’m kind o’ old.
But I’ll stick as long as I can. So ‘adios,’ an’ be good
to yoreself.”</p>

<p>This was the last time that Jimmie saw old Jack.
He died on the trail, away over at the San Carlos River
toward the White Mountain country, and was buried
there under some beautiful trees.</p>

<p>The general also paid Jimmie a visit in the MacDowell
hospital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p>“Well, my boy, how are you getting along?” he
greeted, gazing down with his peculiar grave smile.</p>

<p>“All right, thank you, sir,” asserted Jimmie, whose
leg nevertheless pained like sixty.</p>

<p>“The pack-mules returned in fine shape—fine
shape,” abruptly spoke the general. “Not a sore back,
or a sore hoof. That’s the way mules ought to be
handled, always.”</p>

<p>Located here thirty miles east of present Phoenix,
Arizona, Camp MacDowell was not an unpleasing post
at all. The Salt River, flowing west, was a few miles
below; and scarce a mile east the Verde or Green River
rippled down to join it. Hazy against the eastern horizon
rose the Four Peaks of the Mazatzal, in whose
southern face had occurred the cave battle.</p>

<p>The post buildings were thick adobe, with shingle
or clay roofs; there were cottonwood trees, for shade;
and through the post ran a wide acequia or irrigating
ditch.</p>

<p>During all of January, February and March, in the
new year 1873, the hunt for the outlaws continued.
In bitter weather they were chased from hiding-place
to hiding-place amidst the mountains, and given no rest.
Then, on the seventh or eighth of April, Hank Hewitt
and a party of the MacDowell packers appeared at the
post. They were thin and weather-worn: long-haired,
long-whiskered, and grimy with smoke and bacon-grease.</p>

<p>According to Hank great work had been done.
Chief Chalipun—or “Charley Pan,” as they called him—had
sent word that he would come into Camp Verde<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
and treat with the general for peace. Already three
hundred other Yavapais and Hualpais had surrendered
at Camp Grant.</p>

<p>Naturally, Jimmie was eager to get up to Verde,
meet Joe, and the rest, and report for active duty. He
had thrown aside his crutch; the only thing that bothered
him now was a limp, and an occasional twinge
when he twisted his leg.</p>

<p>So he gladly rode north with Hank and others, by
the military road up the Verde River for Camp
Verde, ninety miles.</p>

<p>He was just in time. The general was here; the
last of the scouting parties, under Lieutenant Almy and
Lieutenant Bourke, had arrived from the Tonto Basin;
Chief Big Mouth, Alchisé, Nan-ta-je, Bobby Do-klinny,
and Micky Free were here, with the triumphant White
Mountains; and Chief Chalipun himself had brought in
three hundred more Yavapais, for the peace talk.</p>

<p>The happy Crook men all looked as tough as had
Hank Hewitt’s squad. The majority of them wore
canvas suits, like the general’s; and the suits, and the
faces, and the hair and whiskers, told a tale of many
smoky campfires and hard marches.</p>

<p>“Hey!” Joe greeted. “That doc. stretched one
leg more’n he did the other! Old Jack said he’d left
orders to have ’em both stretched alike.”</p>

<p>Poor old Jack! But Jimmie laughed bravely, and
he and Joe shook hands. Micky Free pattered across
in his ragged moccasins, grinning. His brick-red hair
hung upon his shoulders, his red moustache had increased,
his one blue eye danced in his freckled tanned
face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span></p>

<p>“How, Cheemie!” he hailed. “You’re all right?
Good! A three-legged deer runs faster than a four-legged
deer. You did not miss much. We had no
fights like the cave fight.”</p>

<p>There was not much time for hobnobbing. Chalipun
was anxious to talk with the general, and the general
was anxious to settle matters with Chalipun; and
everybody wished to hear the confab. On this, the
sixth day of April, 1873, the talk occurred.</p>

<p>The general sat in a chair on the porch of the post
headquarters. With him were Captain and Brevet
Colonel J. J. Coppinger, Twenty-third Infantry, who
commanded Camp Verde, a number of aides, and spare,
black-whiskered Antonio Besias, the Apache-speaking
Mexican interpreter; and Nan-ta-je.</p>

<p>The general also had grown whiskers. A sandy
full beard it was, rather thin on the chin but bunching
thickly down from the cheeks.</p>

<p>“Tell Chalipun I am ready to hear what he has to
say,” directed the general, to Antonio.</p>

<p>Chief Chalipun, his black snaky hair cut square
across the forehead and confined by a band of red
flannel, stood straight and spoke with fierce energy.</p>

<p>“My people are done fighting the white people,”
he said in good Spanish. “We have come in because
we want to be at peace. The Gray Fox has too many
cartridges of copper, and we have very few. We can
fight the Americans alone, but now our brothers are
fighting against us, too, and we do not know what to
do. We cannot sleep at night, for fear of being surrounded.
We cannot hunt, because there are always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
soldiers within sound of our guns. We cannot cook
mescal, because the smoke and the smell of our fires
bring the soldiers to us. We cannot live in the valleys;
the valleys are full of soldiers. And when we
hide in the snow of the mountains, our Apache brothers
follow us, with soldiers. We have no place to go; our
men and women and children are dying. We want to
be at peace with the whites, and be told what to do.”</p>

<p>“I have heard what Chalipun has said,” answered
General Crook—Antonio Besias translating, sentence
by sentence, into Spanish. “It is good. I will take
him by the hand. If he keeps his promise to live at
peace and stop killing people, I will be the best friend
he has ever had. If any of his people have died, that
was their own fault. I sent messages to them, asking
them to come in. When they refused, I had no way to
do but to fight them and kill them.</p>

<p>“The Yavapai have said that the white people
began the war. It is no use now to talk about who
began the war. There are bad men among all peoples.
There are bad Americans, and bad Mexicans, and bad
Apaches. The thing to do now is to forget this, and
to make a peace that will last forever. It must be a
peace not only between the red men and the white men,
but also between the red men themselves. There must
be no more fighting and stealing.</p>

<p>“The red men in Arizona shall live by the white
man’s laws; they shall be treated exactly as the white
men are treated, and shall not be punished unjustly.
If they think that they are being treated unjustly, they
must tell the soldier-captain who has charge of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
reservation, and he will do right by them. They must
remain where they are put, as long as there are any bad
Indians out in the mountains to make trouble. They
must not cut off the noses of their wives, as a punishment.
They shall have their own soldiers, to arrest
drunkards and thieves and other bad persons. They
shall be allowed to work and earn a living, like the
white men. And the sooner they go to work, the
better, because when a man has nothing to do, he is
liable to get into mischief.”</p>

<p>With that, the general advanced and shook hands
with Chalipun. The assembled Yavapais seemed
satisfied.</p>

<p>“It was a good talk,” agreed Jimmie and Micky.</p>

<p>“Where do you live now, Cheemie?” asked Micky,
as the council broke up. “There is no old Camp
Grant, and there will be no Apaches to watch, at the
mouth of the Arivaipa.”</p>

<p>That was true. Old Camp Grant had been abandoned,
and a new Camp Grant established by the general,
in a better country about fifty miles southeast,
half-way to Camp Bowie. The Arivaipas and Pinals,
and the Yavapais and Hualpais who had surrendered
first, were being removed to the new San Carlos reservation,
over toward Camp Apache.</p>

<p>“Joe has his ranch, though,” reminded Jimmie.</p>

<p>“Yes; but he has no post to sell to. You come
to the White Mountain country, and we will talk
Apache and hunt and go to war together.”</p>

<p>“The war is almost done, Micky. A big peace is
being made.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span></p>

<p>“No,” declared Micky, with a shake of his red
head and a thoughtful squint of his blue eye. “Chuntz
is still out, and Delt-che is still out, Naqui-naquis of
the Tonto is still out. The Chiricahua have no police,
no soldiers, no anything over them; they do as they
please. This is not fair, the White Mountains think.
Did you know that Major Brown and Lieutenant
Bourke have been to see Cochise?”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” asserted Micky. “They were sent down
there by Cluke, before the last scout. Cluke has had
orders to let the Chiricahua alone, but he wanted to
get a talk with Cochise. Cochise is for peace, because
he is living where he chose to live. Maybe, though,
his young men will grow tired of one spot; then who
will stop them, says Alchisé?”</p>

<p>“The general will,” assured Jimmie.</p>

<p>“Cluke will try hard,” wisely assented Micky.
“He will follow them—his trail has only one end.
But you cannot turn Apaches into white men all at
once. I look to see more fighting.”</p>

<p>In April Delt-che the Red Ant made one last vengeful
raid. But the troops and scouts were hot after
him. Major George M. Randall of Camp Apache did
the final work, this time. In the night of April 21 he
and his men climbed on hands and knees up the steep
slope of Diamond Peak in the Tonto Basin. Here, on
the top of the Yavapais’ “medicine mountain” they
surprised the Delt-che band at dawn and drove them
over the edges of the precipice.</p>

<p>Delt-che and his surviving people were brought into
the reservation at Camp Verde.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span></p>

<p>At the various posts there was read, to the troops
on parade, a message from Division Headquarters:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noic"><span class="smcap">General Orders No. 7</span></p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Headquarters Military Division of the Pacific</span>,<br />
San Francisco, Cal., April 28, 1873.</p>

<p>To Brevet Major-General George Crook, commanding the
Department of Arizona, and to his gallant troops, for the extraordinary
service that they have rendered in the late campaign
against the Apache Indians, the Division Commander extends
his thanks and his congratulations upon their brilliant successes.
They have merited the gratitude of the nation. There is now
occasion for hope that the well-deserved chastisement inflicted
upon the Apaches may give peace to the people of Arizona.</p>

<p class="right">By order of Major-General Schofield.</p>
</div>

<p>General Crook also issued congratulations, in General
Orders No. 14, Department of Arizona:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The operations of the troops in this Department in the late
campaigns against the Apaches entitle them to a reputation
second to none in the annals of Indian warfare. In the face
of obstacles heretofore considered insurmountable, encountering
rigorous cold in the mountains, followed in quick succession by
the intense heat and arid waste of the desert; not infrequently
at dire extremities for want of water to quench their prolonged
thirst; and when their animals were stricken by pestilence or the
country became too rough to be traversed by them, they left them,
and, carrying on their own backs such meager supplies as they
might, they persistently followed on, and, plunging unexpectedly
into chosen positions in lava-beds, caves and canyons, they have
outwitted and beaten the wildest of foes, with slight loss comparatively
to themselves, and finally closed an Indian war that
has been waged since the days of Cortez.</p>
</div>

<p>Jimmie heard the orders read at Fort Whipple,
where he was herding horses for the quartermaster’s
department. A scourge of epizootic had played havoc
with the army animals, and much of the cavalry required
remounting. The new horses were driven to
Whipple from Los Angeles and San Diego of California,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
in bunches of several hundred at a time, to be
divided among the posts.</p>

<p>This was rather a poky job, but if the war had
ended, a fellow needs must do something.</p>

<p>Joe Felmer had decided to quit scouting and ranching,
and try prospecting. So he had headed for
Tucson.</p>

<p>The two thousand Yavapais, Tontos and Apache-Yumas
at Camp Verde were content. Everybody
working, with worn-out tools they had dug an irrigating
ditch five miles long, to water fifty-seven acres of
land, and were putting in crops. The general had
promised them that they should be paid money, the
same as white people, for whatever they raised to sell,
and they believed him.</p>

<p>From Camp Apache and the San Carlos agency
there came encouraging reports. In the south the
Chiricahuas were quiet. Mexico complained that stock
was being stolen and run across the line into the Chiricahua
reservation; but Agent “Staglito” or Red-beard,
who was Tom Jeffords, declared that this was
done by the Chief Whoa outlaws in Mexico.</p>

<p>Arizona did indeed seem at peace, for the first time
in three hundred years.</p>

<p>“Lieutenant Almy is killed! Almy’s been
murdered!”</p>

<p>“What! Where?”</p>

<p>“At San Carlos! An Injun shot him. There’s
been an uprising.”</p>

<p>The word sped rapidly through Fort Whipple. It
was a noon of the first week in June, and Jimmie had
ridden in to dinner just on time to see a courier dash
across the parade-ground for the adjutant’s office.</p>

<p>Chief of Scouts Al Sieber appeared, walking fast.
The men made a rush for him.</p>

<p>“What’s that, Al? Almy killed?”</p>

<p>Al spoke tersely.</p>

<p>“Yes. At San Carlos. Chan-dezi (Long-ear)
shot him. Chuntz was in it, too; he and Cli-bic-li
(Tied Horse) and Cochinay. The Chuntz gang have
been hanging ’round the agency, and sneaking in at
night for food and to make mischief. The Tonto and
Yavapai had hatched a scheme to kill the agency whites,
this month, and take to the hills. But they got hold
of some whiskey on the reservation, and broke too
soon. The agency police started in to arrest the
chiefs. Long-ear tried to lance Agent Larrabee.
Yomas, a friendly, knocked the lance aside. There
was a mob. Almy undertook to do the arresting himself.
Went in among them alone—bravest act I ever
heard of. Long-ear shot him dead and made a getaway,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
with Chuntz and Cochinay. That was May 27.”</p>

<p>“Does it mean a little scout, Al?” they hopefully
queried.</p>

<p>“No, I think not, boys. The hostiles probably
won’t leave the Gila Canyon, there, and the troops and
the police can corral them. But the general’s going
over.” Al saw Jimmie, and beckoned him apart.
“Are you fit for a trip to Apache?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Sieber.”</p>

<p>“That’s good. Joe Felmer asked me to keep an
eye on you, whenever I was around, and I’ve been
thinking that it’s a little dull for a boy of your calibre
to be herding horses all the time. Well, the general
and some of the rest of us are starting for Apache in
the morning, to look into this fracas. They need
horses, over there. The quartermaster’s a good friend
of mine, and I’ll just drop a hint that now might be
a proper time to send a bunch in, and you with it.
That’ll help you to learn the country. You’ll be forgetting
how to speak Apache if you stay here talking
horse.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to go mighty well, Mr. Sieber,” Jimmie
admitted.</p>

<p>“All right. Micky Free’ll be glad to see you.
He asks about you every time I run across him.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sieber hastened on. A fine man, was Al
Sieber. He spoke Spanish and considerable Apache;
had lived among the White Mountains at Camp
Apache, and was a great favorite with Chief Pedro,
there. “Man of Iron,” the White Mountains called
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span></p>

<p>He was of powerful build, and stern-looking; apt
to be of few words, right to the point; but he had a
kind heart. He was now acting chief of scouts, from
Whipple and Camp Verde.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Jacob Almy dead—murdered? That
was shocking news. Everybody liked First Lieutenant
Jacob Almy, of the Fifth Cavalry. Since he had been
put in charge of the Indians at San Carlos, by his
gentle but firmly just methods he had made many
friends among them, also.</p>

<p>General Crook was energetic, as usual. He set out
early the next morning, on “Apache” his mule, with a
small escort including Lieutenant Bourke his chief
aide, and Al Sieber. Jimmie and a Mexican herder
accompanied, driving the bunch of remount horses.</p>

<p>The loose horses traveled well. The trip of two
hundred and fifty miles through the roughest country
in Arizona was accomplished in ten days.</p>

<p>There had not been much talk on the way over.
The general acted grimly determined, and in a hurry.
Camp Apache was found saddened and expectant.</p>

<p>Having turned his horses over to the post quartermaster,
Jimmie saw Micky waiting for him, beside
the corral here back of the parade-ground. Micky was
sitting a spotted pony, and smiling broadly. He certainly
had the knack of always being on hand.</p>

<p>“Hello, Boy-who-sleeps. Have you come over to
fight?” greeted Micky.</p>

<p>“Has there been a fight yet, Micky?”</p>

<p>“Only a little one, when those Chuntz men ran
away. But we are ready.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span></p>

<p>“Where is Chuntz?”</p>

<p>“He and Long-ear and Cochinay are hiding in the
canyon of the Gila. Tied Horse has been arrested.
If we go after those others there will be good fighting.
The canyon is deep and long and full of caves. Would
you like another cave fight, Cheemie?”</p>

<p>“I’d like to get Chuntz and Long-ear,” vowed
Jimmie.</p>

<p>“So would I. Come on. Pretty soon Sibi the
Iron Man will talk with old Pedro, and you and I will
want to hear what they say. Sibi can talk Apache,
but he cannot talk as fast as Pedro, or as you and I.
We will help.”</p>

<p>The general was in confab at the post headquarters
with Major Randall and Al. There were fifteen hundred
Pinals, Arivaipas, Yavapais, and Tontos at San
Carlos—many of them now very restless under guard.
Nobody might foretell just what was about to happen.</p>

<p>Soon after Jimmie had begun a sort of a reunion
with Alchisé and Nan-ta-je and Bobby Do-klinny and
others, at the Camp Apache agency building, Mr. Sieber
came riding by.</p>

<p>“Jimmie,” he summoned, with crook of finger,
“you ride along with me. I may have use for you.
Bring Free, if you want to.”</p>

<p>“I’m going for a talk with Pedro,” he continued,
in Spanish, so that Micky might understand. Micky
knew no English. “If he talks too fast for me, I want
one of you to explain. And the same way if I speak
with words that he doesn’t know.”</p>

<p>“We will talk for you, Sibi,” answered Micky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span></p>

<p>Old Chief Pedro of the White Mountain Apaches
was, as everybody said, the wisest, most sensible chief
among the tame Indians. They found him at home,
sitting upon a blanket in the shade of a tree near his
house. Since he had come back from Washington he
had put up a board shanty, to live in instead of a brush
wickyup. He was still wearing a white shirt—which
was white no longer.</p>

<p>In spite of the soiled ragged shirt, a splendid old
Indian he looked to be.</p>

<p>“You are well come, Sibi,” he remarked. “Sit
down and we will talk. But who is this boy with one
leg shorter than the other? I do not know him.”</p>

<p>“He is a friend of mine, and of Micky Free,”
replied Al. “He was captured by Geronimo, and lived
with Cochise and Geronimo. He was a soldier at the
cave fight when the Yavapai were destroyed. He is a
brave boy. The leg was made short by a wound. We
may speak freely before him.”</p>

<p>“That is good,” answered Pedro. “I know you,
and I know this wild Red-head. Now I know this
other. I remember who he is. What have you come
to say, Sibi? Did Cluke send you?”</p>

<p>They all sat down: Al beside Pedro, but Jimmie
and Micky a little way apart from them, as was correct
when in the company of chiefs.</p>

<p>“The Gray Fox is talking with Major Randall,”
said Al. “That was bad work at San Carlos, Pedro.
You are a wise chief, and you know Apaches. General
Crook wishes to do what is right by all the Apaches.
He wishes peace, so that we may all live together and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
prosper. No one prospers long in war. What is the
best course to follow with these bad Indians? Can
they be made good?”</p>

<p>“Let us talk in Mexican, Sibi,” spoke Chief Pedro.
“And if you or I use words that are not understood,
the Red-head or maybe the short-leg boy will explain.
This talk must be very clear. Now, there is no way
to make those bad Apaches good, except to kill them.
The bad Indians do not know what I know; they have
not been to the cities of the Great White Father and
seen how powerful he is. I will give Cluke one hundred
and fifty of my warriors, smart fighters all. Let
Cluke send them into the Gila Canyon. The Gray Fox
is brave, and his white soldiers are brave, but the
Chuntz people will go where his soldiers cannot follow;
this is summer, and they know every spot in the canyon,
and will hide.</p>

<p>“But my Apaches will find them, and kill some of
them. Then my men will come home, and rest a
while, and go out and kill more. By winter time there
will be fewer of the mean Apaches; and if they do not
all die during the winter, in the spring we will kill the
rest of them. But if Cluke waits till winter, before
that time the bad Indians will have made much more
trouble at San Carlos, and perhaps among my White
Mountains, and perhaps among the Chiricahua.”</p>

<p>“I will think on what you have said,” responded Al.</p>

<p>“It will be no use to send you or any other person
into the canyon, to spend words on those people,” proceeded
Pedro. “They will burn him, and will send
back an old woman to tell Cluke to give them more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
of his men, to burn. Now I am done, Man of Iron.
I cannot read from paper, but I can look at the actions
of a bad Indian, and can read how he feels and what
he will do.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” mused Al, as with Jimmie and Micky
he rode away. “I believe old Pedro is right.”</p>

<p>The next afternoon the general held a talk at the
San Carlos agency with Es-kim-en-zin, of the Arivaipas,
and with those Tonto and Yavapai chiefs who had
not joined Chuntz.</p>

<p>The San Carlos agency was seventy miles southwest
from Camp Apache, where the San Carlos River
emptied into the Gila. This San Carlos reservation
was really an addition to the southern boundary of the
White Mountain reservation. It was sixty miles wide
and extended clear to the New Mexico line, one hundred
and twenty miles. The eastern half was rough
and mountainous, but the western half, along the Gila
River, was flatter and more open—especially around
the agency, where the Indians were supposed to live.</p>

<p>The majority of the Apaches did not like it. They
said that it was low, hot and unhealthful.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to hear that there are bad hearts at
work among you,” spoke the general. Concepcion
Equierre translated. “They have deceived you into
believing that the white people might be killed, and
that the Apaches might be free to rob and murder
again. Now the innocent have suffered. Lieutenant
Almy, one of your best friends, has been killed, and
you all are prevented from going about on hunts and
visits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span></p>

<p>“I want you all to live as free as the white men.
I do not expect you to stop being red men. I want
your women to gather mescal and seeds and roots, and
your men to hunt deer and turkeys without fear; for
these things are good to eat. But you cannot do this
without fear, when there is war.</p>

<p>“Now about these Chuntz and Long-ear bad men.
I have thousands of soldiers, and many Apache scouts,
and they are enough to give the bad Apaches no rest.
But I want you to punish your own bad people. You
must send out your own warriors, and keep sending
them out until Chuntz and Long-ear and Cochinay are
killed or captured, and their people surrender. It is
not right that a few bad men should work so much
harm to everybody. I hope that you will consider
what I have said. I am done.”</p>

<p>All that summer of 1873 and into the next summer
the San Carlos and White Mountain police, assisted
by cavalry and infantry detachments patrolling the
hills, harassed the outlaws. Wherever the Chuntz
people moved, in the Canyon of the Gila, the reservation
Apaches were ferreting them out.</p>

<p>Some of the outlaws sent in word that they were
ready to surrender. They were told that they might
come in if they brought Chuntz, Long-ear and Cochinay.
Finally the outlaws were hunting their chiefs.</p>

<p>Cochinay was killed on May 26, 1874; Long-ear
was killed on June 12; Chuntz the villain was killed
on July 25. A whole sackful of heads was spilled by
the Apache police upon the ground in front of Major
John B. Babcock’s headquarters, at San Carlos, to
prove that “peace” was being made!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span></p>

<p>Over at Verde, Delt-che had broken out and had
been killed, in July.</p>

<p>So by mid-summer of 1874 the bad-hearted chiefs
seemed all out of the way, at last. Old Cochise, also,
had died, in June, on the Chiricahua reservation, and
Taza was the head chief. He could be depended upon,
for peace.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Jimmie was helping to run the first
telegraph lines in Arizona, connecting military post
with military post. He stayed in telegraph work some
years—during which a number of things happened.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XVIII">XVIII<br />
<small>“CLUKE” GOES AWAY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The general’s plans had apparently worked out all
right, when for no especial reason, as far as Arizona
could understand, the management of the reservations
was changed from the Military Department of Arizona
to the civilian agents appointed by the Indian Bureau
at Washington. The soldiers were to be retained only
as guards and not as instructors.</p>

<p>The Indian Bureau started in to move the Apaches
about. That had been tried two years before, when
in New Mexico Chief Victorio’s Warm Spring
Apaches had been ordered from the Cañada Alamosa
to the hated Tularosa tract. But General Howard had
obtained from the President permission for them to
live again at their beloved Cottonwood Canyon.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1874 it was reported that the
Camp Verde Indians were to be taken over to the San
Carlos reservation. The Camp Verde lands were desired
by the white people.</p>

<p>General Crook had much opposed this scheme. He
was powerless, but he sent a protest to the War Department,
saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There are now on the Verde reservation about fifteen hundred
Indians; they have been among the worst in Arizona; but
if the Government keeps its promise to them that it shall be their
home for all time, there will be no difficulty in keeping them at
peace, and engaged in peaceful pursuits. I sincerely hope that
the interests that are now at work to deprive these Indians of
this reservation will be defeated; but if they succeed, the responsibility<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
of turning these fifteen hundred Apaches loose upon the
settlers of Arizona should rest where it belongs.</p>
</div>

<p>All that winter of 1874–1875 the general (who had
given his word) and Chief Chalipun strove against the
threatened change to the San Carlos reservation. But
it was of no avail.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1875 the general had been transferred
to the Department of the Platte, with headquarters
at Omaha, Nebraska. He had pacified the
Snakes in the Northwest and the Apaches in the Southwest;
now he was needed to subdue the bold-riding
Sioux and Cheyennes of the great northern plains.</p>

<p>He took with him Lieutenant John G. Bourke, chief
of staff, and other officers whom Jimmie so well knew.
Tom Moore, chief packer, was to follow with the best
of the pack-trains. The Third Cavalry already was in
the north; and the Fifth Cavalry was soon to go.</p>

<p>“Cluke has been sent away. The Apaches have
lost their best friend,” mourned Chief Chalipun; and
submitted to being removed. So the Yavapais and the
Apache-Yumas at Camp Verde left their ditch and
fields, and went to a strange region—that of San Carlos.</p>

<p>Young Second Lieutenant George O. Eaton, of the
Fifth Cavalry, was the only man whom they would
trust, to take them over. Even at that, on the way
they had a fight among themselves, and eighteen were
killed and fifty wounded.</p>

<p>The White Mountains were moved, next, down to
the San Carlos. Their reservation was to be closed.</p>

<p>Whatever the reasons of the Indian Bureau, Chiefs
Pedro, Pi-to-ne and others objected bitterly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span></p>

<p>“These are our lands,” asserted Chief Pedro.
“They were promised to us by the great one-armed
soldier-captain, Howard. When I went to Washington,
our White Father there told me again that if we
were good, these should be our lands forever. We
have been good. We have done as we were asked to
do. We have raised more crops than all the other
Apaches put together. We have helped the soldiers
fight our brothers. We are contented here. But we
are mountain Indians and we cannot live down there
in the low country where the water is bad and the air
is hot. The Pinals and the Arivaipas are not friendly
to us, and the Yavapai ways are not our ways.”</p>

<p>Finally eighteen hundred of them were herded
down to the San Carlos. Some hid out, and after a
time many stole back from the San Carlos. The soldiers
at Camp Apache permitted them to stay.</p>

<p>The next year, 1876, the Chiricahua reservation
was broken up. It had no soldiers and no Indian
police, and was too near the border. Whiskey-sellers
and outlaw Apaches sneaked in, but Taza said that if
the American government would help him he could
keep the bad people out.</p>

<p>“Why does Washington punish good people on
account of bad people?” he asked, when told that the
Chiricahuas must go.</p>

<p>At last, with about three hundred of his Chiricahuas,
he went to the San Carlos. Geronimo agreed
to go, too; but he and Chief Whoa, who had come in
from Mexico, and old Nana, and Nah-che, and four
hundred others, ran off into Mexico.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span></p>

<p>The next spring they returned to visit Victorio’s
Warm Spring band at the Cottonwood Canyon reservation.
Because of this, Chiefs Victorio and Geronimo
were arrested, and all the Indians were started, under
guard, for the San Carlos.</p>

<p>On the way Chief Victorio escaped, with forty warriors.
After this he made war on the Americans until
he was killed in 1880. He claimed that he had done
no wrong, and that he never could trust the Americans
again.</p>

<p>“The policy of concentration,” was what the Indian
Bureau called its scheme to place all the Apaches upon
the San Carlos reservation. “A policy of concentrated
trouble,” Al Sieber said.</p>

<p>And that proved true.</p>

<p>Soon the San Carlos reservation contained about
five thousand Indians, good and bad; some working,
some lazy. There were Yavapais, Tontos, Coyotes,
Apache-Yumas, Chiricahuas, Pinals, Arivaipas, Sierra
Blanca (White Mountains), and even a few Hualpais.
They had different habits. The Indian Bureau seemed
to think that one Apache was just like another Apache,
but General Crook had known better.</p>

<p>Whiskey was being smuggled in or manufactured;
white miners and ranchers and prospectors were trespassing,
and large sections of the reservation had been
lopped off for other uses; the agents were accused of
selling the Indians’ supplies outside, instead of distributing
them properly or storing them; the Indians
quarreled among themselves, and even some of the
White Mountains had revolted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span></p>

<p>So in the early morning of April, 1882, Jimmie
Dunn, riding telegraph line up along the Gila River
from Camp Thomas, had plenty to think about. Jimmie
was a young man, now, with a limp (an honorable
limp) but with a good hard head.</p>

<p>Camp Thomas had been established just at the
southeast corner of the San Carlos reservation, or
thirty-two miles up the Gila from the agency quarters.
Jimmie’s business as line-man was to ride between
Thomas and the second Camp Grant, and to see that
the line was in order.</p>

<p>There was still constant trouble at San Carlos.
The Apaches there had no faith in the Government.
The good ones saw little reason in remaining good.
Their only reward had been San Carlos, and they hated
San Carlos. The Chiricahuas especially were restive.
A long time ago Taza had died, while in Washington
trying to talk for his people. Geronimo was head
chief, and Nah-che was his partner in everything.</p>

<p>Parties frequently broke away from the reservation,
for Mexico. At this very moment Chief Whoa and
Nah-che were out again, with a band. They had fled
to join old Nana, who at almost ninety years was living
wild!</p>

<p>Geronimo and two hundred of his Chiricahuas, and
Loco and the Warm Spring Apaches, were at the San
Carlos, but likely enough they would run away, too,
whenever they took the notion. They despised the
Taza people as “squaws” and cowards; the other
Indians, in turn, despised them as trouble-makers.</p>

<p>General Crook was in the north. He had conquered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
the Sioux and the Cheyennes, and was busy
keeping them at peace.</p>

<p>General O. B. Willcox, of the Twelfth Infantry,
commanded in Arizona. The Sixth Cavalry had replaced
the Fifth Cavalry. But there were not enough
soldiers, most of the white interpreters and scouts had
been discharged, and the Apache police were supposed
to maintain order upon the reservation.</p>

<p>The military telegraph had connected all the army
posts. There was a civil telegraph, also—for the railroad
had arrived.</p>

<p>The Southern Pacific Railroad crossed the southern
part of the Territory, about by the old stage route.
Through the northern part of the Territory the Atlantic
&amp; Pacific Railroad was crossing the great Mogollon
Plateau, where General Crook had broken a trail in
the campaign of ten years ago.</p>

<p>The telegraph line had puzzled the Apaches very
much, as “big medicine.” They called it “pesh-bi-yal-ti”—“the
talking wire.” But they were learning
to interfere with it by cutting it, and inserting a little
piece of rubber. Then the wire quit “talking.”</p>

<p>A sharp eye was required to see such a break, which
usually was near a pole or tree up which the Indians
had shinned. Jimmie had the eye. Also, he was not
afraid. He was accustomed to the country, and to
the Apaches.</p>

<p>Sometimes he saw parties of them. If they were
running away, they were in too much of a hurry to
stop. If they were hunting, they were friendly.
However, the run-aways did not cross hereabouts.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
They took another route, further east, along the New
Mexico western border.</p>

<p>As a rule, Jimmie rode with a partner; but to-day
his partner was ill. Jimmie felt capable of repairing
any break by himself, whether the Indians had made
it, or whether the limb of a tree had fallen. The line
had to be ridden, anyway.</p>

<p>The military road was very quiet. It stretched on,
up hill and down, through timber and open parks, with
the Gila River on the left, and far on the right, or the
south, the dark Pinaleno Mountains, beyond which
lay Camp Grant. Pretty soon the telegraph line would
head down there. He would ride on until he met another
rider, coming from Grant.</p>

<p>The San Carlos reservation was behind, to the
northwest, on the other side of the Gila; and away in
the north, beyond a high ridge, was the White Mountain
reservation, with old Camp Apache that was now
Fort Apache.</p>

<p>He was about ten miles out of Camp Thomas, and
jogging easily. The only moving things that he had
sighted were rabbits and squirrels, and once or twice
a deer. But now when from a rise he looked across
the Gila, he saw, in the distance to the north, a great
cloud of dust.</p>

<p>That froze him. It appeared mighty suspicious.
Many people, and horses or cattle, would stir up such a
dust. In that case, Indians! This was not white
man’s country.</p>

<p>If they were Indians, they were moving very fast,
and striking east, like run-aways from San Carlos. Or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
was it cavalry, riding hard? But if it was cavalry, that
meant Indians, too.</p>

<p>Well, he’d soon find out. The Gila, running bank
full, was some distance below; the country beyond,
approached by the dust, was open and rolling. He had
a fine view. So sitting his horse, Jimmie whipped off
his field-glasses and leveled them. Ash Flats sprang
into the field; and here surged the brown dust, and
under it, into the clear of a little swale, streamed a mass
of hastily scurrying figures.</p>

<p>Indians, sure!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XIX">XIX<br />
<small>JIMMIE SENDS THE ALARM</small></h2>
</div>


<p>First there were fifteen or twenty mounted warriors,
as an advance guard. Then there followed about
one hundred and fifty other warriors, all with rifles,
and stripped and painted to fight. Then there trooped
and jostled a large procession of squaws and children,
mostly afoot, herding a tremendous bunch of loose
horses and mules, and packing camp stuff.</p>

<p>There must have been five hundred squaws and
children, and six or seven thousand animals, not counting
dogs! A small guard of warriors were riding the
rear flanks of the march. It certainly was a big outbreak
of the San Carlos Chiricahuas, and they were
hot-footing for Mexico!</p>

<p>Whew! Where were the police and the soldiers,
then? Jimmie swept the landscape for sign of them,
and saw nothing. He clapped his glasses closed. His
eyes leaped to the nearest telegraph pole. His duty
was clear. He ought to send word at once to Camp
Thomas.</p>

<p>Just as he was about to swing down, tie his horse,
and climb the pole, he sighted, with a last glance of
his eye, four Indians swimming the river below, with
their ponies. Either he had been seen, or else they
were coming to cut the wire. Maybe both.</p>

<p>Already the foremost was urging his pony up out
of the water’s edge, to the bank on this side. Of course
they had seen him, as he sat! But he still had a chance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
to race back, to the fort, and give the alarm. No;
that would lose an hour, or more. Likely enough the
wire from San Carlos to the fort had been cut; at the
rate that those Chiricahuas were traveling, every minute
was precious if they were to be headed off.</p>

<p>He ought to climb the pole and tap the wire. If
he could not raise Thomas in the one direction, he
might raise Grant, in the other. But he’d have to work
fast. Lives were at stake, for no settler could stop
those bronc’s.</p>

<p>Jimmie resolutely tumbled off his horse, in a jiffy
strapped on his climbing irons, left his horse, and his
rifle in scabbard (a rifle would be of no use up there),
and ran for the pole. And this was a brave act, for
he might easily have run, horseback, in another direction—back
to Camp Thomas, or to hide in the farther
timber until the Indians had gone after cutting the wire.</p>

<p>At top speed he shinned up the pole, and digging in,
rapidly unshipped his line-man’s little sending kit, in
order to break in on the wire and call the Camp Thomas
operator. He did not dare to watch the movements of
those four Indians.</p>

<p>No doubt the four were coming full tilt, up from
the river and through the brush; but if he tried to
watch them he would be nervous and make false
motions. The thing for him to do was to clamp on to
that line, and <em>get there first</em>. That required swift, sure
work, and all his attention. So he endeavored not to
think of the four Indians.</p>

<p>Never had he felt so high in the air, and so much
exposed. Almost any other pole would have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
better, but none had been as near and convenient. He
made a splendid mark, like a hawk roosting in a dead
tree.</p>

<p>“Ping!” A bullet! They were shooting at him!
“Pung!” That was the report, following. “Whing!”
“Pung!” But he must not mind the warning. He
needed only a minute more. As he worked rapidly
his fingers seemed all thumbs. He did not dare to take
his eyes off them. “Thud-bang!” The bullet shook
the pole, and the report was so close that the shooter
could not be far away. He heard shrill yells, somewhere
below——</p>

<p>“Whack-bang!” A heavy hammer fell on the top
of his shoulder, and well nigh knocked him from his
perch. He clung desperately, wrapping himself
tighter—his shoulder stung and was oddly warm—but
it was his left shoulder, he was on the wire at
last, and was sending with his right hand.</p>

<p>“D,” “D,” “D,” he called Camp Thomas.</p>

<p>There was thud of hoofs below, a chorus of angry
yells—“Whish-bang!” a bullet fanned his cheek—“Ping-bang!”
another cut a large sliver from the pole
close to his neck—“D,” “D,” “D,” he kept calling,
even while he glanced aside.</p>

<p>The four Indians were into the road and tearing
for him, rifles leveled upward—he saw smoke, heard
the bullets—but the Thomas operator had answered.</p>

<p>“I—I D,” “I—I D.”</p>

<p>Now for the ten seconds’ grace!</p>

<p>“Injuns out. Big band——”</p>

<p>Camp Thomas broke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span></p>

<p>“Repeat. Who are you?”</p>

<p>“Too nervous. Steady, boy,” cautioned Jimmie, to
himself. He was not an expert operator, anyway.
But this was a crisis.</p>

<p>He hastily started to repeat. The four Indians
were right at the foot of the pole, yelling at him.</p>

<p><a href="#i_frontis">“Get down, get down!” they ordered, furiously,
in Apache.</a> He gazed full into their upturned, painted
faces—and into the muzzles of their rifles; and he
grinned sickly and continued to send.</p>

<p>“Injuns out. Big band. Sig., Dunn. Injuns out.
Big Band. Sig., Dunn. Injuns out. Big band. Sig.,
Dunn.”</p>

<p>Would Camp Thomas never O. K.? Would those
muzzles below never belch their balls and rip him and
hurl him headlong?</p>

<p>“No tiras (Don’t shoot)!” suddenly yelped one
of the voices, from one of the painted faces.</p>

<p>Nah-che! And Chato (Flat-nose), too! The muzzles
were lowered—the scowling Chato’s last of all.</p>

<p>“Come down, chi-kis-n,” ordered Nah-che.</p>

<p>But Jimmie only shook his head, while he worked
his key.</p>

<p>“Come down or we shoot you down,” blared Flat-nose;
and he drew a deadly bead.</p>

<p>But Thomas had broken in at last.</p>

<p>“O. K. Where?” ticked Camp Thomas.</p>

<p>“Ash Flats. Head east. Bronc’s and squaws.”</p>

<p>“O. K. Get off wire,” answered Camp Thomas.</p>

<p>“Bang!” sounded Chato’s rifle, and Jimmie’s little
instrument flew into fragments. But Jimmie cared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
not, now. He went sliding painfully down; landed
right in the midst of the four Indians, staggered—two
of them were afoot, waiting for him—they sprang at
him, and wrenched his revolver from its holster. They
acted as though they were going to kill him, or take
him along, when Nah-che interfered.</p>

<p>“No!” he ordered, while Chato scowled. But
Nah-che was obeyed, because he was a grown warrior
and son of Cochise. “What were you doing, chi-kis-n?”
he demanded.</p>

<p>“I talked with Camp Thomas,” answered Jimmie,
defiantly.</p>

<p>“What did you say?”</p>

<p>“I said that the Chiricahua were running away.”</p>

<p>The three other Indians murmured angrily. The
two young bucks besides Nah-che and Chato Jimmie
did not know. He had not seen Nah-che and Chato
for several years, either. They had grown. Chato
was ugly, because of his flattened nose, but Nah-che
was supple and handsome.</p>

<p>“No matter,” said Nah-che, to his companions.
“This is my brother. He did right. He is brave.
He shall not be harmed. Give him his gun and let him
alone. We are not afraid of the soldiers.” He addressed
Jimmie. “Yes, chi-kis-n, we are running
away—all the Warm Springs and Chiricahua except
the Taza band. There are many of us, and we know
there are not enough soldiers in Arizona to stop us.
We can whip the Camp Thomas soldiers first, and whip
the rest as they come. Geronimo is with us, and Loco,
and one hundred warriors who belong to Juh and me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span></p>

<p>“Why are you running away, chi-kis-n?” asked
Jimmie. “I thought you and Juh were already run
away. People said you were in Mexico.”</p>

<p>“We were,” replied Nah-che. “We live in Mexico.
That is the only place for us. Nana is there, too;
and Chihuahua. Now Juh and I have come up to help
Geronimo and Loco get away.” He began to talk
hotly. “Why do we all run away? That is a foolish
question. We will not be moved around so, and put in
sickly places among Indians who don’t like us. We
would have stayed at our home in the Dragoon Mountains,
and have been happy. A few of us drank
whiskey sold us by bad white men, and we all were
blamed. The San Carlos is not a good place. The
White Mountains tell false stories about us, the agents
steal our rations from us and we go hungry. The
white traders would rather sell things to us, and cheat
us. So Juh and I ran away. Now there is talk that
the white men want all the San Carlos country, because
of mines, and that the Apaches will be taken
away, many miles, to a strange land. Geronimo says
he has been told to come to Camp Thomas, for a talk—and
if he goes there, he will be put in prison again;
maybe killed, like Mangas Coloradas was killed. We
would rather die on the warpath than die in prison or
in a strange land. So we all, the Chiricahua and the
Warm Springs, except Taza’s squaw-people, will live
in the Mexican mountains. There we can lead our own
life. The Mexicans dare not fight us, we have plenty
guns and plenty food, the American soldiers cannot
cross the line, to follow us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t you fool yourself,” retorted Jimmie.
“Crook will come, and he will go anywhere.”</p>

<p>“Cluke is a good man. If he had stayed, maybe
there would be peace instead of war,” responded
Nah-che. “There has been one other good man, at
San Carlos. He was the soldier-captain Chaffee.
Why does the White Father at Washington let us be
cheated, like children, by dishonest agents? Why does
he listen to bad tongues, that say we must not stay
where we were promised we might stay? But good-by,
chi-kis-n. Now there is war between us. The Chiricahua
are never coming back to be cheated again. You
have been chi-kis-n; but you are American and I am
Apache, so when we meet in war, look out for yourself.
It will be man to man. We are no longer boys.”</p>

<p>Nah-che wheeled his pony. With a whoop, away
they four tore, flourishing their guns.</p>

<p>Jimmie gazed after only for a moment. Then he
was aware that all his left shoulder and arm were
red and paining. The bullet had slashed a furrow
an inch deep through the muscles of the upper arm, but
the blood was clotting and he did not pause to tie a
bandage on.</p>

<p>He unstrapped his climbing irons, kicked them off
as he stooped to pick up his revolver, and hobbled for
his horse; mounted and raced for Camp Thomas.</p>

<p>Camp Thomas had only two reduced companies of
the Sixth Cavalry. When he got there, the two
companies were drawn up in column of twos in front
of the adjutant’s office, as if ready to start out. Micky
Free was here, with a party of White Mountain and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
Tonto scouts. The telegraph instrument was clicking
rapidly.</p>

<p>“Hello, Cheemie!” intercepted Micky, gaily, in
his Spanish. “You been fighting, what?”</p>

<p>“Not much,” panted Jimmie, pulling short.
“When do you start?”</p>

<p>“Pretty soon, when the talking wire is done.
They are telling what you said, to the other posts. You
did good work, Cheemie. The wire from San Carlos is
cut, but Tom Horn (he was a white scout and packer
at San Carlos) brought more news by horse, and Sibi
has been here. Now they are out, spying on the trail,
and we will follow. It has been a big outbreak.”</p>

<p>“Were you there, Micky?”</p>

<p>“No; but I heard it, and the agency Indians have
signaled, and Tom Horn was there. All the Chief
Loco Warm Springs and the Geronimo Chiricahua
have gone. They number seven hundred. The trouble
was this. You know Stirling?”</p>

<p>Jimmie nodded. Mr. Stirling was chief of the
agency police. These were not scouts, but Indians
appointed by the agent as policemen.</p>

<p>“Some days ago Stirling tried to arrest a Chiricahua
who had been making whiskey. The Chiricahua
ran and Stirling missed him and hit a squaw. That
turned the Chiricahua bad, although Stirling said he
was sorry. They have been getting bad anyway, because
there is talk that all the Indians are to be moved
far away, so that the Americans can dig coal on the
reservation. Last night Juh and Nah-che sent in word
that they were near, waiting to help Loco and Geronimo.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
This morning the Chiricahua and Warm Springs
began to pack up, and Stirling and Navajo Bill, a policeman,
charged them alone, to break them up. The
Chiricahua had been waiting for this. They shot Stirling
one hundred times at once, and a squaw cut off his
head and it was kicked about like a ball. He was a
very brave man, that Stirling. Navajo Bill wasn’t
hurt, but another policeman was killed, and one Chiricahua.
Now the Warm Springs and Chiricahua are
out—and I think they will keep right on going.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Jimmie soberly. “I met
Nah-che. He came while I was talking on the wire.
He says that all the soldiers in Arizona cannot stop
them.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” agreed Micky. “They have two
hundred fine warriors, and better guns than the soldiers’
guns. They nearly all have those guns that
shoot sixteen times, and lots of ammunition. The
soldiers are scattered, and before we get together, and
the New Mexico soldiers get together, Geronimo will
be into Mexico. What was Nah-che doing on this side
the river? The squaws and children cannot cross,
with the horses. It is too high.”</p>

<p>“I think Nah-che brought a party over to drive me
away or kill me. He had Chato with him, and two
others. But he made them quit shooting at me. We
are chi-kis-n.”</p>

<p>“That won’t count again,” warned Micky. “So
watch out, next time. This is war, and long war.
Now you’d better get your arm fixed, Cheemie. The
Loco and Geronimo band will have to keep on, up the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
river, until they can cross. They will strike south,
near New Mexico, until they cross the border. There
are no soldiers, ahead in that country, to stop them;
and they wouldn’t care if there were. But we’re to
meet Sibi and follow and fight as well as we can, under
the ugly long-nosed man.”</p>

<p>That was Lieutenant George Gatewood, of the
Sixth Cavalry, at Thomas. He came in a hurry out
of the adjutant’s office.</p>

<p>“All ready,” he barked, to the junior lieutenant, his
second in command, and swung into the saddle.</p>

<p>“’Ten-<em>shun</em>! Column—march! Trot!”</p>

<p>The bugle sounded briskly, and away they went, in
long column, the red and white guidons flapping, Micky
and his scouts galloping to the advance.</p>

<p>Jimmie proceeded to have his arm bandaged, and
to talk with the operator. Then he reported at headquarters,
but he had little to tell that was not already
known. He felt, though, that he had done his duty.</p>

<p>While his shoulder was healing, the troops of
Arizona and New Mexico struck the hostiles several
times, down at the border, but did not turn them.</p>

<small>THE GRAY FOX RETURNS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Crook is coming back! General Crook is coming
back!”</p>

<p>That was the word at Camp Thomas, in this the
early summer of 1882, a couple of months after the
Geronimo outbreak.</p>

<p>The Third Cavalry already had arrived from its
northern plains campaigns, and the Sixth was being
stationed over in New Mexico. But the Sixth had
done well, and the best news was that which bore the
name of Crook. He had been ordered from the Department
of the Platte to the Department of Arizona,
again.</p>

<p>“Now we shall see the Chiricahua grow tired,”
laughed Micky Free, when Jimmie met him. “Sibi
is glad; the White Mountains are glad; everybody will
be glad, except Whoa and Geronimo. Are you going
to help fight, Cheemie, instead of riding all the time
along the talking wire?”</p>

<p>“You bet I am, Micky,” declared Jimmie. “Hope
Tom Moore’s coming, too. I reckon if my leg won’t
let me scout I can join the pack-train.”</p>

<p>General Crook wasted no time. Scarcely had he
announced himself at Fort Whipple, ere he was bound
for San Carlos and Fort Apache, to straighten out
these affairs first.</p>

<p>Jimmie rode over to the fort with a party from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
Thomas, to learn the latest. The general was there,
with Lieutenant Bourke, now a captain. Wearing an
ancient, smoked and scorched corduroy suit he had
arrived on the same “Apache,” his mule. He looked
rather older than when he had left, back in 1875.
The campaigning in winter up north had been tough.
But he acted as energetic as ever.</p>

<p>He held a council with the dissatisfied White
Mountains.</p>

<p>“I want to have all that you say here go down
on paper,” he addressed. “What goes down on paper
never lies. A man’s memory may fail him, but the
paper does not forget. I want to know from you all
that has happened since I went away, to bring about
this trouble between you and the white men. I want
you to tell the truth without fear, and in few words.”</p>

<p>Old Pedro had listened attentively to the general
through an ear-trumpet, for Pedro had grown quite
deaf. He answered.</p>

<p>“When you were here, if you said a thing we knew
that it was true. We cannot understand why you left
us. The people who have come among us talk in one
way and act in another. And I remember the other
officers, too, who treated us kindly. I used to be
happy; now I am all the time thinking and crying, and
I say: ‘Where is old Colonel John Green, and Randall,
and those other good men?’”</p>

<p>Alchisé spoke.</p>

<p>“When you left us, there were no bad Indians
out. Everything was peace. But I think that all the
good men must have been taken from us and only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
bad ones sent in. We did not mind having no rations,
for we had learned to take care of ourselves. Then
one day we were ordered to give up our fields and go
down to the hot land of San Carlos to live. I have
tried hard to help the whites, and they have put me
in the guard-house. Where did you go? Why doesn’t
Major Randall come back? Where is my friend Randall,
the captain with the big moustache that he always
pulled?”</p>

<p>The general was very patient with all who wished
to talk. Then he took a pack-train and rode into the
depths of the Black Canyon, where a number of the
Apaches lived because they feared arrest.</p>

<p>The Apaches here, also, claimed that they had been
mistreated. They had set a spy to watch the agent
at San Carlos, and had caught him selling their rations.
Then they had sent a man to tell the agent that he must
not do this, and the man had been kept in jail for six
months without any trial. They said that they had
been getting only one cup of flour every seven days.
One shoulder of a little cow had to last twenty persons
for a week.</p>

<p>It was another long story, and the general promised
that he would help them.</p>

<p>“I think there will be peace at Fort Apache and
at the San Carlos,” Micky asserted, as he and Jimmie
rode back after the council was over. “And if the
Chiricahua will stay in Mexico and kill only Mexicans,
you and I will have no fun, because the Gray Fox
cannot make war in Mexico.”</p>

<p>“Maybe the Chiricahua will stay there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span></p>

<p>“No. After a time the young men will get tired
of killing and robbing Mexicans, which is easy. They
will want to win honor by robbing the Americans—and
then, we shall see.”</p>

<p>At Camp Thomas Jimmie met the general face to
face while crossing the parade-ground. He had small
hopes that the general would remember him when he
saluted—but something in the general’s keen, inquiring
eye made him halt and stand expectantly.</p>

<p>“Well, my man,” blurted the general. “I seem to
know your face.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I’m Jimmie Dunn.”</p>

<p>“I remember. You still limp a little, I see. What
are you doing now?”</p>

<p>“I’m a telegraph line-man, sir.”</p>

<p>“That’s good. You had a talk with Nah-che, when
he was on his way out, last spring, didn’t you? Do
you think he can be persuaded to come in peaceably?”</p>

<p>“He might if he knew you were back, sir. But he
said the Chiricahua hadn’t been treated well—they were
out to stay.”</p>

<p>“The Apaches have grievances. The worst of the
outlaws are better than the whites who have been
robbing them.”</p>

<p>The general was about to stride on, when Jimmie
hastily spoke.</p>

<p>“But if you go against the Chiricahua, I’d like
to go too, sir.”</p>

<p>“That will be a hard and maybe a long chase,”
gravely said the general. “Probably into the Mexican
mountains, with picked men. You can help by sticking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
to your present business. The telegraph and the railroad
are very necessary.”</p>

<p>Jimmie, thinking it over afterward, almost decided
likewise. His leg bothered him, and his shoulder was
still tender. Chasing Geronimo through the Mexican
mountains, with a leader who never rested, required
nerve and strength both.</p>

<p>The general tried to hold a conference with the
Geronimo runaways. From the border he sent a party
of Apache scouts under Alchisé across, for a few miles,
but they found no traces of the Chiricahuas.</p>

<p>Two Chiricahua squaws were captured while returning
to San Carlos. They said that the Geronimo
band had a strong hiding-place deep in the Sierra
Madre Mountains several days’ travel below the border;
were living off the Mexicans, and knew that the
American soldiers could not come down there.</p>

<p>General Crook assigned Captain Emmet Crawford
of the Third Cavalry (a broad-shouldered six-footer)
to the military station at San Carlos, obtained permission
from the Indian Bureau for the White Mountains
to live upon the high, cooler lands near Fort Apache
and to plant crops there, and from headquarters at
Fort Whipple issued an order that said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Officers and soldiers serving in this department are reminded
that one of the fundamental principles of the military character
is justice to all—Indians as well as white men—and that a disregard
of this principle is likely to bring about hostilities, and
cause the death of the very persons they are sent here to protect.
In all their dealings with the Indians, officers must be careful
not only to observe the strictest fidelity, but to make no promises
not in their power to carry out; ...</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span></p>

<p>As long as the Chiricahuas stayed out of the United
States, there was not much more to be done. The
Apaches on the reservations seemed content again;
the border was being patrolled by one hundred and
fifty Apache scouts, in the hope of catching the trail
of any outlaws who might venture up; the telegraph
was kept in fine working order, and the troops at the
posts were given constant practice marches.</p>

<p>This fall and winter no word came from Geronimo.
But in March (which was the year 1883) the expected
news broke—and bad news it was.</p>

<p>Jimmie chanced to be in the telegraph office at
Thomas when the message came. He took it off the
wire as fast as the operator did. It was from Bowie,
in the south.</p>

<p>“Band of hostiles crossed line raiding north
through Whetstone Mountains. Heading west for
New Mexico probably. More.”</p>

<p>“Where’s that adjutant?” barked the operator,
tearing off his sheet. “Things are hummin’. Gee
whizz, isn’t that man ever around when he’s needed?”</p>

<p>But the adjutant of course got the message at once.</p>

<p>“More” came thick and fast, from all directions.
The Chiricahuas numbered only twenty-six warriors.
They were under Chato, the Flat-nose. They had
dodged the patrol, outwitted all the troops and volunteers,
the telegraph and railroad did not stop them; on
a circle of eight hundred miles, traveling at seventy-five
miles a day they swung through Arizona and
southwestern New Mexico, stealing fresh horses whenever
needed, and killing miners and settlers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span></p>

<p>“Picked men for the pursuit,” were the orders from
the general at Whipple. This appeared to leave
Jimmie, with his lame leg, out of scout service. Well,
he might do some good in his regular job, anyway.
But the last news was the worst news of all.</p>

<p>Near Silver City, southwestern New Mexico, a
horrible act was committed by the Chato band. They
overtook Judge H. C. McComas, driving on the main
road with his wife and little boy, Charley; they tortured
and killed the two grown-ups, and carried off
Charley, aged six years.</p>

<p>This made soldiers and settlers alike furious.
Jimmie could stand the strain no longer. He had
been captured, once, himself. He threw aside his line-man
position and rode over to Fort Apache, to find
Frank Monach, pack-master.</p>

<p>“I want a job, Frank.”</p>

<p>“Thought you had one.”</p>

<p>“I had, but I’ve left. I’m too lame for scout
work; I can pack, though. How about it?”</p>

<p>“Well,” drawled Frank, sizing him up, “the old
man’s partic’lar. The pack outfits have got to be the
kind that’ll keep agoin’. We’re due to follow those
bronc’s till we get that boy back, even if we travel clear
to the City of Mexico.”</p>

<p>“I know. That’s why I’m here,” retorted Jimmie.
“I can pack and sit a mule.”</p>

<p>“All right. Old Jack Long’s watchin’ you, I
reckon. He took a lot o’ stock in you. You’re hired.
So get your war-bag an’ fall in.”</p>

<small>TO THE STRONGHOLD OF GERONIMO</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Fight to a finish, or a surrender, b’gosh,” announced
Frank, to-day. “Chiricahuas can take their
choice. But the old man’s goin’ after ’em. We’ll
have no murderin’ an’ boy-stealin’ in this department.
Everybody, man an’ mule, is ordered to meet him at
Willcox, pronto (quick). So this outfit’ll hit the high
places in the mornin’.”</p>

<p>Jimmie and the other packers at San Carlos, where
they had been waiting prepared, gave a cheer. It was
now the first week in April. The killing of Judge
McComas and Mrs. McComas, and the stealing of little
Charley, had occurred on March 28. Chato had
escaped into Mexico again, having lost only one
warrior, except——</p>

<p>“Did you hear tell thar’s a Chiricahua buck been
fetched in who claims he broke from the Chato bunch
’cause he wants peace?” queried Long Jim Cook.</p>

<p>“No. Where is he?”</p>

<p>“In the guard-house. They got him locked up
till the old man talks with him. His name is
‘Peaches,’ or somethin’ like that.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe he brings some sort o’ word from Geronimo.
You know the old man sent one of those squaws
that he captured, back down, last fall, to tell the
Geronimo band they’d better change their minds.”</p>

<p>Jimmie asked Micky Free.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span></p>

<p>“He is not a Chiricahua,” said Micky. “He is a
White Mountain, but he married two Chiricahua
squaws, so he had to live with the Chiricahua. His
name is Pa-na-yo-tish-n (Coyote-saw-him). He does
not like the Chiricahua, now. They are living in the
mountains five days’ travel from Arizona. They have
plenty wood, plenty water, plenty grass, plenty meat,
and kill plenty Mexican soldiers with rocks because they
must save cartridges. That is why Chato made his
raid up north: to get cartridges. Pa-na-yo-tish-n ran
away. He says he does not want to fight, and there are
others who do not want to fight, but they are afraid
of Geronimo. He knows the trail to Geronimo, and
will lead the general straight. Then maybe we talk,
maybe we fight. It will be a good fight, Cheemie.
Geronimo has seventy men, and fifty big boys who can
fight like men. Yes, if they have powder, and do not
get starved, and the talk is bad, we will see much fun.
I think that even the packers will better watch out
sharp.”</p>

<p>Micky Free always had hopes. He was a regular
fire-eater.</p>

<p>The cavalry from Fort Apache, and the pack-train,
and about one hundred Apache scouts from the San
Carlos and the White Mountain reservations marched
across country to Willcox. Pa-na-yo-tish-n (whom
the soldiers and packers called “Peaches”) was taken
along, as a prisoner, in handcuffs.</p>

<p>Willcox, the nearest station on the Southern Pacific
Railroad, just west of Railroad Pass over the Chiricahua
Mountains, was overflowing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span></p>

<p>The Camp Thomas troops had arrived; so had those
from Fort Bowie, to the southeast. By train other
troops, and horses and mules, and ammunition and
supplies of all kinds were pouring in. The general
and his staff were here. So were Charley Hopkins and
“Short Jim” Cook and others of the old-time packers;
and Archie MacIntosh and Al Sieber, the chief scouts;
and Antonio Besias the interpreter; yes, and Maria
Jilda.</p>

<p>It was a great reunion of Crook men.</p>

<p>Reports said that the United States and Mexico
had arranged to pursue Indians into each other’s territory,
but the United States troops were not to cross
the boundary before May 1. In order to make certain
that this was understood, the general traveled by
the Mexican Central Railroad into the northern Mexican
States and talked with the commanding officers
there.</p>

<p>When he returned he talked again with “Peaches.”
“Peaches” stuck to his story, and when the general
directed that the irons be removed from him,
“Peaches” said that he was willing to wear them until
it was shown that he had spoken only the truth. But
the irons were taken off anyway, because Alchisé and
other scouts engaged to watch him very closely.</p>

<p>On April 22 there was a parade, and inspection of
the whole outfit. That night the Apache scouts held
a big war-dance which lasted until morning. They and
Micky (who had danced as hard as anybody) were still
hot and excited when the column was formed for the
advance.</p>

<p>The scouts, and pack-mules, and a line of rumbling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
army wagons, and portions of seven companies of the
Third and Sixth Cavalry, marched from the railroad
to the boundary at San Bernardino Springs in southeastern
Arizona, one hundred miles by the wagon trail.</p>

<p>Stalwart Captain Emmet Crawford brought in one
hundred more Apache scouts from San Carlos. There
were war-dances and medicine ceremonies each night.
Alchisé and others told the general that their medicine
was showing up very strong; the Chiricahuas would
surely be found and killed or captured.</p>

<p>“That is so,” asserted Micky, who believed in the
medicine.</p>

<p>Six of the cavalry troops were to be left here at
the border, to guard it and the wagons with the extra
supplies.</p>

<p>“Adios, amigo,” bade Maria, to Jimmie. “You
will have good luck. The medicine says so, and Pa-na-yo-tish-n
will lead Crook straight. But it will be a
long march, maybe two hundred miles.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going, Maria?”</p>

<p>“No. I stay, because I know all this country.”</p>

<p>It did not look like a very great force, after all,
which at sunrise of May 1, this 1883, crossed the border
to find Geronimo. There were more Indians than soldiers—one
hundred and ninety-three of them, White
Mountains, Tontos, Yavapais, Apache-Yumas and
some of the Taza friendly Chiricahuas.</p>

<p>Captain Crawford, of the Third Cavalry, commanded
them. He had as his assistants Lieutenant
George Gatewood and Lieutenant W. W. Forsythe, of
the Sixth, and Lieutenant James O. Mackay, of the
Third.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span></p>

<p>The forty cavalrymen of the Sixth (less than half
a company) were commanded by Major Adna R.
Chaffee and Lieutenant Frank West.</p>

<p>The general’s staff was Captain Bourke, and Lieutenant
G. J. Febiger of the Engineers. Doctor
Andrews was surgeon. Archie MacIntosh and Al
Sieber were chief scouts. Micky, and old Severiano
the Mexican who had been brought up by the Apaches,
and Packer Sam Bowman were interpreters.</p>

<p>The pack-masters of the five pack-trains were
Frank Monach, Charley Hopkins, of Tucson, “Long
Jim” Cook and “Short Jim” Cook, and George
Stanfield.</p>

<p>“One blanket and forty rounds of ammunition to
each man,” were the orders. The mules carried additional
ammunition and sixty days’ rations of hard-tack,
coffee and bacon. Everybody was well armed with the
Springfield forty-fives, and Colt’s revolvers; even the
packers had carbines and pistols.</p>

<p>Plainly enough, the general was outward bound on
business!</p>

<p>“U-ga-shé (U-gah-shay)!” barked Lieutenant
Gatewood, at the scouts. And away they went, afoot,
in their red head-bands and flapping shirts and leggin-moccasins,
across the boundary, with Alchisé and
“Peaches” in the lead, as guides. They all spread
out in a broad front, to cover the country. Their officers
rode just behind, with Archie MacIntosh and
Sieber the Iron Man.</p>

<p>The general and aides and cavalry escort followed.
Then there ambled the long files of pack-trains—Frank<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
Monach’s first. A guard of the cavalry closed
the rear.</p>

<p>The “good-by” and “good luck” cheers of the
border guard died in the distance. The march to
“get” Geronimo, Nah-che and the other Chiricahuas
had actually begun.</p>

<p>At first about twenty-five miles a day were covered.
But the country grew rougher and hotter. Only two or
three of the Mexican villages were inhabited; many
others were deserted and in ruins, on account of the
Chiricahuas. The brush along the streams was thick,
the flowers were large and bright. High, bluish mountains
loomed on right and left and before.</p>

<p>It was fine Apache country, all right—and
“Peaches” was leading straight into it, for within
a few days fresh moccasin tracks might be seen
frequently.</p>

<p>“To-morrow for the Sierra Madre,” said Frank
Monach, in camp on the night of May 7. “Then
we’ll be hangin’ on by our toe-nails. What I’d like to
know is, whether Geronimo’ll wait for us or whether
he’ll keep a-goin’ himself.”</p>

<p>The huge jumble of the Sierra Madre range
frowned directly before. It certainly appeared mighty
rough. No white men had yet ventured to penetrate
far into the Sierra Madre; but the general was determined,
as Al Sieber said, “to open it up.”</p>

<p>He was so anxious, that this night the march had
continued until after eleven o’clock, and camp had
been made without fires, in the bottom of a deep canyon.
So dark it was that even the mules lost their places.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span></p>

<p>The climb of the first flanks of the Sierra Madre
was begun at daylight. The trail that led out of the
canyon was littered with plunder—torn letters, Mexican
dresses, scattered flour, and beef carcasses. It was
so steep that several of the mules fell off, and landed
one hundred feet below, in a canyon. But they were
not hurt.</p>

<p>The Chiricahua sign became more plentiful.
“Peaches” said that Geronimo’s real stronghold was
still several days’ march before, but that this was as
far as the Mexican soldiers ever had got. The Chiricahuas
had ambushed them and driven them back.</p>

<p>To-night everybody except the scouts was very
tired. Jimmie ached from head to foot; the job of
forcing the mules on was the hardest work of all.</p>

<p>“Come, Cheemie,” invited Micky. “You come
with me and you will see big medicine made.”</p>

<p>Jimmie groaned, and hobbled after Micky Free.</p>

<p>What with chasing deer and turkeys and rabbits,
to eat, and hunting the Chiricahuas, the scouts had been
having a great time. They had never been too tired to
dance and yarn; to-night their medicine-men were to
find the Chiricahuas for them.</p>

<p>The officers messed with the packers and scouts;
it was all one family. The general and Captain Bourke
had joined the Monach mess, where Alchisé and other
principal scouts ate, too. So the general and the captain
were admitted to the circle of the medicine-making.</p>

<p>The chief medicine-man lay in a trance while the
lesser medicine-men squatted around him and sang.
Soon he thumped his chest and spoke, telling his dream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span></p>

<p>“Keet,” the Apache boy who carried the medicine
things and was in training for a medicine-man, himself,
translated for the general and Captain Bourke.</p>

<p>“What did he say?” asked the captain. “The
general wishes to know.”</p>

<p>“He say: ‘Me can’t see ’um Chilicahua yet.
Bimeby me see ’um. Me ketch ’um, me kill ’um. Me
no ketch ’um, me no kill ’um. Chilicahua see me, me
no get ’um. No see me, me ketch ’um. Me see ’um
little bit now. Mebbe so six day me ketch ’um; mebbe
so two day. Tomollow me send twenty-fibe men to
hunt ’um tlail. Mebbe so tomollow see ’um more. Me
ketch ’um hoss, me ketch ’um mool, me ketch ’um cow.
Ketch Chilicahua pretty soon, bimeby. Kill ’um heap,
an’ ketch ’um squaw.’”</p>

<p>That impressed the scouts. They were sure of
success.</p>

<p>The signs grew fresher and fresher, and the trail
worse and worse. But abandoned rancherias were
found—and they had not been abandoned long, either!
The eager scouts fairly ran hither-thither, searching
and signaling; the cavalry-men toiled afoot, leading
their horses; and the pack-mules, urged on by Jimmie
and the other packers, coughed and slipped and sweat,
and six of them rolled a thousand feet and were dashed
to pieces.</p>

<p>But the general showed no token of quitting. He
was after Geronimo.</p>

<p>Now it was the night of May 10. In the morning
Captain Crawford and his scouts were going ahead,
by themselves. Alchisé had insisted that this was the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
only way to do. He complained to the general that the
soldiers and the pack-trains were too slow, to catch
the Chiricahuas.</p>

<p>Frank Monach came into camp from a reconnoiter
with a few of the soldiers and the huskier packers.
Jimmie could not go. His leg was rather bad.</p>

<p>“B’gosh, we found where a passel o’ Mexicans
had been wiped out with rocks an’ arrows an’ lances,”
announced Frank. “Over yonder in the foothills.
They must have come in from the other side.”</p>

<p>This night the scouts were very busy, making
medicine and mending moccasins and preparing meat
and bread.</p>

<p>“Medicine man say ‘Kill ’um heap Chilicahua,
three day from tomollow,’” declared young “Keet,”
proud of his English words.</p>

<p>Early in the morning one hundred and fifty of the
scouts, with Captain Crawford and Lieutenant Gatewood
and Lieutenant Mackay, Archie MacIntosh, Al
Sieber, and Micky and Severiano and Sam Bowman,
hastened ahead.</p>

<p>They were to fight and to surround, and try to
hold the Chiricahuas until the soldiers arrived. The
dismounted cavalry and the pack-trains followed at
best speed, again into the heart of the high country.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXII">XXII<br />
<small>WAR OR PEACE?</small></h2>
</div>


<p>During the next few days Captain Crawford sent
back several notes, to say that by the signs he was
likely to strike the Chiricahuas at any moment. The
pursuit was closing in. Maybe the medicine-men were
right. They had prophesied “Three days from to-morrow,”
which would be May 14.</p>

<p>But May 14 passed without especial event. Then,
at one o’clock noon of May 15, in a little box canyon
there was sudden excitement among the cavalry ahead
of the Monach pack-train. Jimmie, first in line at one
side behind the “bell,” saw the Indian runner dart
down the slope, into the trail, and hand a note to the
general.</p>

<p>The general read it. Lieutenant Febiger hastened
back to Major Chaffee, and instantly the trumpet
pealed “Mount!” Into their saddles vaulted the
troopers. Down to the pack-trains galloped Lieutenant
West.</p>

<p>“Close up your outfits!” he shouted. “Be prepared
for action. Crawford’s scouts have struck the
hostiles.”</p>

<p>“Hooray!” That was good news. Afterwards
it was learned that the foremost scouts had discovered
some Chiricahuas in a canyon, had fired upon two men
and a woman, and had frightened the rest away. The
runner had brought the note six miles across the mountains
in less than an hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span></p>

<p>“Listen to that!” yelped Martin, the cook, from
the “bell.”</p>

<p>Distant rifle-shots sounded faintly. It was a
battle! Captain Crawford’s scouts and the Chiricahuas
were fighting!</p>

<p>The reports welled faster. Every ear was keen set.
Major Chaffee’s cavalry had quickened pace, each
trooper erect in his saddle; the pack-mules were being
forced more compactly, ready for corralling should the
cavalry leave; the general, in the advance with his
aides, clearly was impatient for the country to open
out and the battle-field be sighted.</p>

<p>“Bet they got away, dog-gone it!” yelled back
Cook Martin. For presently the firing dwindled to
spatters, and ceased. Shucks!</p>

<p>“Anyhow, the old man’ll keep agoin’,” voiced the
packer behind Jimmie. “There’s a nice moon for
huntin’ Injuns, an’ we can live on what those bronc’s
are throwin’ away!”</p>

<p>So it was plod, plod, up and down, and down and
up. The troopers dismounted, to lead their horses.</p>

<p>Toward dusk a great smoke was to be seen several
miles away, on a high mountain-side. The pack-train
guessed that a Chiricahua rancheria was being
cleaned up.</p>

<p>The horizon over there flared into red, and while
supper was being eaten, in camp under a glorious full
moon, here came Captain Crawford and his scouts at
last, both afoot and ahorse. They brought also
forty-seven horses loaded with plunder, and five prisoners—two
boys, two girls, and a woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span></p>

<p>Alchisé acted rather disgusted, but Micky Free was
joyful.</p>

<p>“Hello, Cheemie,” he greeted, as he and others
of the scouts squatted near the camp-fires, to eat again.
“We had good fun. It was Chato’s and Bonito’s
rancherias. Alchisé and Sibi are mad because we shot
too soon, and the Chiricahua ran off. We killed nine
and captured those five. We didn’t catch any more.
The country was very rough, and they hid. But we set
the rancherias on fire. There were thirty houses. And
to-morrow we get more Chiricahua.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t the little white boy there, Micky?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he was there, the squaw says. His name
Carlos (Charles); six years old. He was with some
old squaws and they ran off with him. But she says
she can find them in two days. Loco and Chihuahua
want to come back to the reservation; maybe Geronimo
and Chato and Nah-che; Whoa still thinks bad.”</p>

<p>“Where is Geronimo?” asked Frank Monach, in
Spanish.</p>

<p>“Nearly all the Chiricahua men are down in the
south, hunting Mexicans. They will be surprised when
they know the Cluke men have found where they live,
and that Pa-na-yo-tish-n had led us so straight. We
now are inside and they are outside. Inju!”</p>

<p>Everybody was much disappointed that little
Charley McComas had disappeared. If some of the
younger scouts had not shot first without orders the
rancherias might have been surrounded and Charley
rescued.</p>

<p>However, the captured squaw seemed to be certain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
that she could find the older squaws who had him.
Early in the morning she was sent away, with one of
the boy prisoners and two days’ rations. She promised
she would tell the Chiricahuas it was no use to fight.</p>

<p>This was a cold, rainy day, which made the waiting
disagreeable. At night ice formed. In the morning a
smoke signal was seen. The general ordered that it be
answered. “Peaches” guided to a better camping-place,
where there were grass and running water.</p>

<p>Another smoke signal was sent up, but only a few
squaws and children came in. The squaws said that
some other squaws had Charley McComas. One of
the women was the sister of Chief Chihuahua (or
Bonito). She stated that all the Chihuahua band
would surrender as soon as her brother could get them
together.</p>

<p>“The idee of the gen’ral is, not to do any more
fightin’, if he can help it, till that white kid is fetched
along,” explained Martin, the cook for the Monach
pack-train and officers’ mess. “That’s what Cap’n
Bourke says. You see, the leetle fellow’s with the
Chihuahua band.”</p>

<p>The next day Chihuahua (Bonito) himself came
boldly in, to say that he would surrender his people
as soon as he could get word to them all. They were
tired of fighting and hiding.</p>

<p>“That is good,” answered the general. “I have
soldiers and scouts enough to fight the Chiricahuas as
long as they wish to fight. Those I do not kill or
capture I will drive into the Mexican soldiers who
are coming up from the south.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span></p>

<p>“I speak only for my own band,” answered Chihuahua.
“They will make peace, but I do not know
what Geronimo and Whoa will do. If you will let
me take two of my young men and go out again, I can
hurry my people in faster.”</p>

<p>“They must bring the white boy.”</p>

<p>“I will tell them so,” said Chihuahua.</p>

<p>Chihuahua did good work, for the Chiricahuas
kept gathering until there were one hundred and
twenty-one in camp. But they had not brought
Charley McComas, and none of the Geronimo men
had turned up.</p>

<p>Then, at eight o’clock in the morning, a tremendous
outburst of shouts and screeches sounded from
some high cliffs above the camp. More Apaches were
jumping about among the rocks there, as if much
astonished.</p>

<p>“Geronimo!” exclaimed Micky, running.</p>

<p>The camp sprang to arms.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” were yelling the Chiricahuas
above, to the Chiricahuas below.</p>

<p>“The white war-captain has us. We fight no
more,” called the Chiricahuas who had surrendered.
“It is no use. Our own people fight against us.”</p>

<p>Two old squaws clambered half-way down.</p>

<p>“Ask the white war-captain if we will be hurt?”
they screamed.</p>

<p>The general sent out Micky and Scout To-klani
(Plenty Water) and one of the Chihuahua Chiricahuas.
To-klani’s sisters belonged to the Chihuahua band, and
the Chiricahuas all knew him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span></p>

<p>“The white war-captain says that he does not care
whether you surrender or not,” announced To-klani.
“Chihuahua has surrendered. We are only waiting
till the rest of his people and the little white boy come
in. If you come you will not be harmed, but if you do
not come you will be killed.”</p>

<p>This set the Chiricahuas on the cliff to thinking.
Evidently now that they had found their best camping-place
occupied, and so many of the other Chiricahuas
surrendered, they did not know quite what to do. As
Frank Monach remarked: “That’s a heap joke. Expect
we look mighty comfortable, at our little love-feast.”</p>

<p>Within about an hour, the Apaches came down.
It was Geronimo, all right—he, and Nah-che, and
Chato, and thirty-three warriors. They all carried
the latest model repeating rifles, and the best nickle-plated
revolvers, and they stared about very uneasily.</p>

<p>They began to ask questions of the scouts; Nah-che
sighted Jimmie, and sidled over to him.</p>

<p>“Chi-kis-n,” he said.</p>

<p>“Chi-kis-n,” replied Jimmie.</p>

<p>“The last time I saw you I talked straight,” proceeded
Nah-che. “Now I ask you to talk straight, for
we are men. I want to know how you came in here,
with so many soldiers and Apaches and mules, while
we were out hunting the Mexicans. What does Cluke
intend to do?”</p>

<p>“We came in easily, because the White Mountain
who was one of Chato’s men showed us the road. But
the Gray Fox would have brought us anyway. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
American soldiers can hunt Apaches in Mexico, and the
Mexican soldiers can hunt Apaches in the United
States. That is arranged. If Geronimo will not surrender,
let him try to fight. The other Chiricahuas
are going back to the reservation. Geronimo will not
last long. His own people are against him, and he cannot
hide any more in Mexico.”</p>

<p>“That sounds bad,” uttered Nah-che; and he
walked away very downcast.</p>

<p>The general was saying the same thing, and other
things, to Geronimo.</p>

<p>“You should have had more sense than to leave
because of a few troubles,” he scolded severely. “There
is always some trouble in a big camp of Indians. I
want to know what those troubles were, so that I may
correct them. I shall not talk long with you; you
must make up your mind for peace or war. You can
see for yourself that I am not afraid of you. I have
come in here, where you thought I could not come, and
I am not even taking your arms from you. You are
free to stay or go. If you decide to stay and march
with the other Chiricahua to the San Carlos, you will
not be harmed.</p>

<p>“You have done things for which you ought to be
arrested; but if you will promise to behave yourself
and work, I will see to it that you are placed wherever
you choose, on the reservation. I will make soldiers
of your own men, to keep peace in your camp. The
ugly long-nosed man (who was Lieutenant Gatewood)
shall select them, and he will be your officer. He will
see to it that you get whatever you are entitled to get.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span></p>

<p>“But if you do not go back with me, then it will be
war. I will cover all this country with soldiers and
scouts, and the Mexicans and the Americans and the
scouts will hunt you down without stopping. Now I
have spoken. I ask you to leave me and to think this
over, and talk with your men. Then you must tell
me what you have decided, for I do not want there to
be any misunderstanding.”</p>

<p>The council broke up. Geronimo appeared rather
downcast, too. The rest of the day he and his people
kept by themselves. Even Nah-che did not come over
again. It was an anxious period, for the Geronimo
band were able to put up a hard fight still, and the
camp was full of Chiricahuas.</p>

<p>“What do you think Geronimo will do, Micky?”
asked Jimmie.</p>

<p>“He is a smart man, and likes to talk,” answered
Micky. “He is a war-captain. But when he sees that
he is talking alone, he will quit. Cluke’s words stung
him, for no chief likes to be talked at like that. I
looked for a fight right away, and so did Sibi. There
was no fight—it would have been a good fight, though,
with so many Chiricahua all around us. Now I think
that if Geronimo is still here, in the morning, it means
peace.”</p>

<p>Everybody—soldiers, scouts and packers—slept
with one eye and one ear open, this night. But in the
morning Geronimo asked the general for another talk.
It seemed as though the decision had been made.</p>

<p>“I have thought deeply, and have talked with my
people,” said Geronimo. “We were not well treated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
at San Carlos, but if you will be good to us we will
do as you tell us to do. The white man does not see
as the Apache sees, and yet you have made me feel
that I have done wrong. I will go with you to the San
Carlos. But first I ask you to order me to send out
for the rest of my people. They are much scattered,
and they have many ponies and cattle which belong to
them; but if they see only signals they will think them
to be signals set by your scouts, to fool them. And if
I go away and leave them, then the Mexicans will kill
them.”</p>

<p>“You must try to find the white boy,” reminded the
general.</p>

<p>“I will do exactly as you say,” replied Geronimo.</p>

<p>“Is it peace, chi-kis-n?” inquired Jimmie, of
Nah-che.</p>

<p>“It is peace,” answered Nah-che; but he did not
smile.</p>

<p>“Hooray!” cheered Long Jim Cook. “That was
a tall bluff on the gen’ral’s part, I reckon; but it worked.
For a while we were in a bad box, with the camp
runnin’ over with Chiricahua, an’ thirty or forty fightin’
bronc’s up on those cliffs, ready to rake us. I wouldn’t
trust all these scouts, in a pinch, either. They’ve got
too many kin, in the hostiles.”</p>

<p>“D’you suppose Geronimo has somethin’ up his
sleeve, still?” proposed Martin the cook, to Frank
Monach. “He acts awful agreeable.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXIII">XXIII<br />
<small>GERONIMO PLAYS SMART</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“To-morrow we go home,” declared Micky Free,
to Jimmie and Nah-che. They three had been messing
together, as old friends.</p>

<p>It was the afternoon of May 23. Two days had
passed since Geronimo had decided upon peace. He
had kept his word, for the Chiricahuas had continued
to come in—crippled old Nana himself had arrived
this very morning—all the chiefs and captains were
here except Juh, and Juh, or Whoa, need not be expected.
He and his band of one man and two squaws
had gone farther south.</p>

<p>Even Ka-e-ten-na (The Looking-glass), who was a
young war-captain of the Mexican Chiricahuas, part
of Whoa’s people, had come in. Now rations were
being issued by Lieutenant Gatewood to two hundred
and fifty extra persons, including a dozen Mexicans—forlorn
women and children whom the Chiricahuas had
brought with them. But, alas——</p>

<p>“Don’t we wait for Charley McComas?” demanded
Jimmie.</p>

<p>“The white boy?” And Micky shook his red
head. “No. It is too late. He is lost. If we wait
longer, there will be no food. Too many people eat.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t Chato know where he is?”</p>

<p>“Chato says not,” answered Nah-che. “He was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
left with the women. We have asked the women.
They say that on the first day, when Chato’s rancheria
was attacked, the little white boy ran into the bushes.
Nobody has seen him again. He did not come out.
Then there were rains that washed his trail. It was
eight days ago, and we think he is dead.”</p>

<p>The general had questioned the Chiricahuas closely.
They all stuck to the one story, and seemed to be speaking
the truth. Six-year-old Charley probably had been
so frightened that he had run until exhausted and lost
in the dense brush. No trace of him was ever
discovered.</p>

<p>When the general finally issued the order that camp
should be broken in the morning, and the start made
for San Carlos, Geronimo was smiling and ready. He
asked only that the first marches be slow, so that the
Chiricahuas who were still out might catch up. There
seemed to be no end of those Chiricahuas who were
still “out.”</p>

<p>“We expect you to protect us from the Mexican
soldiers,” said Geronimo. “My old men and women
who are coming cannot fight.”</p>

<p>“I will protect you,” promised the general.</p>

<p>This appeared to make Geronimo happy and
satisfied.</p>

<p>However, in the morning a sudden delay occurred.
The pack-trains were loaded and waiting, the cavalry
had formed, all the Chiricahuas were herded together,
the scouts were on the flanks, but the general had sent
for Geronimo—was talking earnestly to him.</p>

<p>Presently Archie MacIntosh came trotting back,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
ahorse, as if with an eye to seeing that everything was
closed up.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble ahead, Archie?” hailed
Frank.</p>

<p>Archie grinned from his sun-burned face, and
paused.</p>

<p>“Just been discovered we’re about a hundred bucks
shy. They disappeared between sunset and sunrise.
Looks as though that old rascal of a Geronimo had
put one over on us.”</p>

<p>“Hi! I said he had somethin’ up his sleeve,”
chuckled Long Jim Cook. “Where they gone? After
plunder, I bet you!”</p>

<p>“Of course,” declared Archie. “And the general’s
raising Cain. He says to Geronimo: ‘Those bucks of
yours are riding south to steal horses and cattle from
the Mexicans.’ And Geronimo, he just smiles and
says: ‘Oh, they wouldn’t rob anybody. They’re looking
for some of our own horses and cattle that we’ve
left.’ And the general says: ‘I won’t allow you to
take any stolen stock across the border. I’d be court-martialed
for it.’ And Geronimo says: ‘Don’t bother
with that. All those Mexicans are good for, is to
grow horses and cattle for the Apaches. We will ride
on slowly. But if there is any trouble with the Mexicans,
you have promised to protect us. Besides, it
will be several days before my men come to join us.’
So the general, he’s regularly up a stump.”</p>

<p>And that was true. For the time being the wily
Geronimo had outwitted him. Without doubt most
of the able-bodied warriors had ridden away for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
purpose of making one last raid, and returning to the
reservation, rich!</p>

<p>The march north was begun. The procession
stretched for more than a mile—the old men and old
women, the wounded, and the little children riding
upon ponies, the women afoot packing great bundles,
and many carrying cottonwood boughs to shield their
heads from the fierce sun.</p>

<p>Soon the Chiricahuas numbered three hundred, the
majority women and old men and children. The herd
of horses and cattle steadily grew. Near the border
a dozen warriors caught up, at night; they brought
fifty horses. But at the camp across the border the
warriors, driving herds of stock, joined in streams,
and the general found that he had three hundred and
sixty-three Chiricahuas and over one thousand horses
and mules and cows bearing Mexican brands!</p>

<p>“Every one of those must be turned back into
Mexico,” he ordered.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Geronimo. “They belong to us.
We bring them, so that we can go to farming, as you
ask us to do. Who cares what a lot of howling
Mexicans say?”</p>

<p>Mexicans, lawyers and angry ranchers claiming
horses and cows were threatening to sue the United
States, and General Crook, for helping to steal Mexican
stock. But many of the brands had been changed
over, and there were disputes without end, the Mexicans
and the Chiricahuas both claiming all the cattle.</p>

<p>So the only way out of the muddle was, to drive the
stock to San Carlos, and sell it, and send the money<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
to the United States treasury. Then the Mexicans
who could prove their claims should be paid.</p>

<p>This did not please Geronimo.</p>

<p>“The Chiricahua will not understand, and they
will not forget,” said Maria Jilda, who was at the
border camp. “You will chase Geronimo and Nah-che
again, Jeemie.”</p>

<p>“Well, I shorely hope not,” quoth Frank Monach.
“Hope we get a chance to rest up, anyhow. The general
and Sieber look about tuckered.”</p>

<p>And that was so. After five hundred miles of
travel through the roughest of mountain country, in
heat and cold and dry and wet, even General Crook
seemed to be worn out.</p>

<p>He kept his word with the Chiricahuas. Geronimo
and the other chiefs were permitted to choose their
own lands, and settled with their people, five hundred
and twelve in number, south of Fort Apache. It was
a fine country, too, on the head-waters of Turkey
Creek.</p>

<p>The general obtained orders from Washington that
all the Chiricahuas should be placed under his control.
This was thought by Arizona to be a very good plan,
because the Chiricahuas, like the other Apaches, had
much faith in “Cluke.”</p>

<p>As the governor said, in an annual message to the
legislature: “The Indians know General Crook and
his methods, and respect both.”</p>

<p>Jimmie stuck at Fort Bowie. He had been appointed
pack-master, there, and this was quite a job
for a boy scarcely twenty-one years old. But he felt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
as though he had grown up in the service; and old
Jack Long had started him off well.</p>

<p>Captain Crawford was in military charge of the
San Carlos reservation. Micky Free was over there,
too, as a sergeant of the Indian police. Lieutenant
Gatewood was stationed in the Chiricahua camp at
Turkey Creek, just as the general had promised. Maria
Jilda took up a ranch; he said that he was tired of
scouting and interpreting. Al Sieber, as chief of
scouts, divided his time between San Carlos and Fort
Apache; and where Archie MacIntosh went, Jimmie
did not know.</p>

<p>But there was no opportunity for being lonesome
at Fort Bowie. Pack-train duties kept a fellow hopping,
if he tried to have a crack outfit—and the only
outfits tolerated by the quarter-master’s department
under General Crook were crack ones. Supplies had to
be packed in from the railroad, fifteen miles, and there
were scoutings and practice marches.</p>

<p>For the remainder of 1883 everything seemed to be
quiet. Reports stated that Geronimo and all the Chiricahuas
were farming and doing famously, and that
the White Mountains, on the other side of Fort Apache,
were getting rich by selling their barley and hay to
the post and to the towns.</p>

<p>Then, as the months of 1884 rolled by, troubles
appeared on the surface. The military and the Indian
Bureau employes did not agree. The military officers,
like Captain Crawford and Lieutenant Gatewood, had
charge of the Chiricahua prisoners, but the Indian agent
had charge of the other Indians. The military was
obliged to keep order at San Carlos and the Fort Apache<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
reservation, both, but the Indian agent had the authority
to direct the farming. The Chiricahuas had been
encouraged by General Crook to mingle with the peaceful
White Mountains, and all the Indians preferred the
soldiers to the civilians.</p>

<p>The White Mountains and Chiricahuas complained
that they were not getting their rightful amount of
meat from the agent. The man sent out to see, reported
that they were getting everything.</p>

<p>Captain Crawford did not agree with the report.
The Indian Bureau asked that he be removed. He demanded
a court-martial. The court-martial found that
he was honest and correct; and that the Apaches, instead
of getting one thousand cows, had been assigned
only six hundred poor ones, with the promise that the
rest should be delivered “when required.”</p>

<p>But Captain Crawford was powerless in the matter,
and the Apaches could not understand why there should
be two fathers over them.</p>

<p>In May young chief Ka-e-ten-na went “bad.” He
was the Mexican Apache chief who had surrendered;
now he made ready to run away, with a band of other
restless Chiricahuas, into Mexico again.</p>

<p>General Crook was at West Point, to address the
graduating class there. However, Ka-e-ten-na was
arrested by his own people, and was tried the same as a
white man, and sentenced to be “shut up till he learned
sense.” He was sent to the United States military
prison on Alcatraz Island, in San Francisco Bay, for
a year; and this proved a very good plan, the same as
the cases of Santos and Pedro and old Miguel; because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
after he had seen how powerful the Americans were
and what a great city they had, he was cured of wishing
to live wild.</p>

<p>“He is only one, though,” said Micky Free, this
fall, while at Bowie on a scouting trip with Tom Horn
who was Al Sieber’s right-hand man. “Sibi thinks
that all the Chiricahua would better be sent to prison.
So does Tom. They have had a talk with Geronimo,
and the only way to do is to send all the Chiricahua out
of Arizona, quick.”</p>

<small>PACK-MASTER JIMMIE MEETS A SURPRISE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Will there be trouble again, Micky?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” laughed Micky scornfully. “Everybody
in Arizona knows that. You see it yourself,
Cheemie. You read the talking papers. The talking
papers of Mexico say that the Chiricahua from Arizona
are sneaking down there and stealing cattle. That is
true. Even Gatewood is getting afraid. He is losing
Chiricahua all the time; they go somewhere and his
counts are always different. I think he will move to
Fort Apache. It is only twelve miles, and he will be
safer.</p>

<p>“The Geronimo Chiricahua see that the San Carlos
Apaches and the White Mountains are unhappy, with
two fathers bossing them. So they trade their goods
for whiskey and guns. Sibi went to Geronimo and
asked him what he was planning to do. Geronimo
said: ‘It is no use to lie to you, Sibi. You read my
thoughts. The truth is this: When my men came up
with Cluke from Mexico they expected to go back every
little while, to get horses and cows. There is no harm
in stealing cattle from those Mexicans. Besides, Cluke
took away the cattle that we first brought up. If my
men are not allowed to do that, they would rather live
in Mexico and act as they please. It is only my talk
that holds them, and some day they won’t listen.’</p>

<p>“To hear Geronimo pretend peace talk would make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
a mule laugh,” concluded Micky. “Now because Cluke
is in Washington we have come down here with Tom
Horn, and Sibi who has a lame leg is coming in a
wagon. They will talk with Bourke. Sibi says to
capture all the Chiricahua and send them far away.
That will end war. But I guess it won’t be done.”</p>

<p>Captain Bourke—who had been promoted to major—was
at Bowie, waiting for the general to return from
Washington. The general had gone to Washington in
the hopes of getting more authority to deal with the
Apaches.</p>

<p>He did not succeed. All this fall and winter of
1884 the War Department and the Interior Department
could not agree upon the control of the
reservations.</p>

<p>The officers at San Carlos staked out an irrigating
ditch for the Apaches to dig, and the agent declined
to permit the digging. The Indians believed nobody.
Captain Crawford asked to be transferred to his regiment,
the Third Cavalry, and Captain F. E. Pierce, of
the First Infantry, was assigned to the military charge
of San Carlos. He had lost an eye in the Civil War.</p>

<p>In February of 1885 Major-General John Pope,
who commanded the Military Division of the Pacific,
from San Francisco announced, to Washington:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If General Crook’s authority over the Indians at San
Carlos be curtailed or modified in any way, there are certain
to follow very serious results, if not a renewal of Indian wars
and depredations in Arizona.</p>
</div>

<p>Consequently, with matters at sixes and sevens, the
outlook at Fort Bowie was very gloomy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span></p>

<p>In the middle of May Jimmie rode down toward
the border, to see how some of the pack-mules in
pasture upon a ranch were getting along. There was
likely to be need of them soon, for the Indians certainly
were going to break out.</p>

<p>It was an all-day ride. The pasture was in some
bottoms among the hills, where there was good water
and grass; so he cooked his own supper and prepared
to sleep out, beneath the stars.</p>

<p>He was just about to turn in, under his blanket,
when he heard Chiquito snort. Chiquito was his horse,
picketed out to graze. The snort might mean mountain
lion, Mexican leopard, wolf, deer, or——!</p>

<p>“What is it, Chiquito?”</p>

<p>Chiquito’s head was up, his ears pricked, he was
staring into the south. He knew a heap, Chiquito did.</p>

<p>Jimmie gazed, too, in the same direction. And
there, far to the southwest, across the Mexican line,
he saw a red gleam on a high hill. A signal fire, sure:
Indian signal!</p>

<p>Jimmie scrambled to his feet and stood peering
intent. Presently the gleam was broken—and then
repeated. Indians down there were signalling for other
Indians to answer. That was plain. Even Chiquito
had known. He was Indian wise.</p>

<p>Jimmie swept the dark horizon again and again,
to catch the answer, but none appeared. His view
from the camp was not very good; but he must find
out what was going on; accordingly he snatched up
his blanket and ran through the brush to the crest of
the slope above him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span></p>

<p>Here he found the right spot, and squatted, with
his blanket wrapped around him, to wait. He did not
dare to build a fire, lest it be seen.</p>

<p>This was a long, cold wait.</p>

<p>The fire in the southwest flared regularly at intervals
of about an hour. “Answer,” it kept saying.
“Answer.” Jimmie eyed the north as well as the south—and
at midnight the expected happened. The signal
in the south had been answered, for it suddenly broke
into a message.</p>

<p>There were one long flash and several shorter ones.
Then, quickly following, two flashes, and an interval,
and two more.</p>

<p>As anybody ought to know, this spelled: “All right.
We will wait two days.”</p>

<p>The fire died. That was the end. Jimmie jumped
to a conclusion. There had been only the one fire in
the south; so the answer had come from the north,
and he had somehow missed it. But the Indians in
Mexico had signalled to some Indians in Arizona, and
were to wait two days!</p>

<p>The Chiricahuas had arranged to run away! Probably
they already were out, making for Mexico, to join
runaways already there. Whew! Great Scott!</p>

<p>Well, all that he could do was to wait until daylight,
and then make for Bowie. And the sooner the
better, because he was right in the track of runaways.</p>

<p>He went down to his camp, and got a half night’s
sleep. In the morning he did not wait to gather his
mules; he saddled Chiquito at daylight and struck out
by the shortest way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span></p>

<p>The country all seemed peaceful. Who might have
foretold that he would bump right into the hostiles?
But that is precisely what happened. He was loping
up a shallow draw fringed by rocks and stunted pines—had
been riding two hours—when as he rounded a
shoulder, on a sudden here there came at headlong
gallop a dozen steers.</p>

<p>He wheeled Chiquito to one side, quick; barely had
time to get out of their way—didn’t have time to get
out of the way of the three young bucks chasing them
full tilt; and before he could spur Chiquito up the
flank of the draw, for cover, he was a “goner.”</p>

<p>With a yell and with guns leveled the three bronc’s
had charged him; a bullet sang by his ear; and he raised
his hand for a talk. They arrived instantly, reined
short, around him. He didn’t know them, and they
appeared not to know him.</p>

<p>“Chi-kis-n,” he attempted. But they only scowled
and talked among themselves in Apache.</p>

<p>“Shall we kill him here?”</p>

<p>“That is best.”</p>

<p>“Stick him with your lance.”</p>

<p>“You talk foolish,” retorted Jimmie boldly, in
good Apache. “There’s no sense in killing me. You’ll
only get in trouble by it. Take me to your chief.”</p>

<p>“Who are you, that speaks Apache?”</p>

<p>“Never you mind who I am,” retorted Jimmie.
“You take me to your chief. If he says kill me, all
right. But you’d better wait till he does say so. You’re
only warriors.”</p>

<p>“Where are the rest of your party, white man?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span></p>

<p>“I’m alone.”</p>

<p>“What is your business?”</p>

<p>“I herd mules.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going?”</p>

<p>“To Fort Bowie.”</p>

<p>“We ought to kill him. He will tell on us if we
let him go,” said one, aside.</p>

<p>“No. We’ll have to take him back,” said the
oldest boy. “There is plenty of time to kill him later.”</p>

<p>They snatched his rifle and revolver from the holsters,
and on either side and behind jostling him along,
drove him up the draw. For the next five minutes
Jimmie figured that his chances were about one in one
hundred.</p>

<p>They rounded the turn; and here, in a little hollow,
was a group of twelve or fifteen men and women kneeling
over two cow carcasses, and butchering them. Several
of the figures looked to see who was coming. One
of them was Nah-che. Jimmie’s heart beat less rapidly.
His chances were increased.</p>

<p>However, Nah-che, standing erect, was not at all
pleased to see him.</p>

<p>“Why are you in here?” demanded Nah-che.</p>

<p>“I came down from Bowie to look at some mules.
Now I was going back to Bowie.”</p>

<p>“Did you know that some of us are off the reservation?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I saw a signal fire last night, in Mexico,
and I read what it said.”</p>

<p>“What did it say?”</p>

<p>“It said that they would wait two days.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span></p>

<p>“That is right,” replied Nah-che. “I am sorry
we met you, chi-kis-n, because now you will be killed.”</p>

<p>“That may be so. But why do you kill me, chi-kis-n?”
challenged Jimmie. “I have done you no
harm.”</p>

<p>“No; we fought against each other, but that was
understood. If you will promise me not to say a word
about us at Fort Bowie I will let you go.”</p>

<p>“You know very well that I would not be a man
if I gave any such promise,” retorted Jimmie. “I shall
not lie to you.”</p>

<p>“If white men never lied to us, then everything
would be all right,” said Nah-che. “They do lie to us,
so you must die. I am sorry, but——”</p>

<p>“No! No!” One of the squaws had rushed up.
She was Nah-da-ste! “This is the Boy-who-sleeps.
I remember him well. He has slept in my lodge and
eaten my food. I won’t have him killed. You had
better let him go. He cannot harm us.”</p>

<p>“No. Fort Bowie is a long way off,” reminded
Jimmie. “Besides, if you are off the reservation, that
is known by this time.”</p>

<p>“Maybe not. We cut the talking wire,” answered
Nah-che. “But it is true that Fort Bowie is a long
way off. Anyway,” he added, “I don’t want to kill
you, and I cannot argue with women. You can go,
chi-kis-n. By the time you tell what you know, we
shall be far in the other direction. So go as fast as
you please, but keep going straight, for you might not
find a chi-kis-n among other Chiricahua.”</p>

<p>“Good,” grunted Jimmie, as his rifle and revolver<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
were passed to him. “I ask one word. Tell me why
you are leaving the Fort Apache country. I wish the
truth.”</p>

<p>“Everybody but Cluke is our enemy. We are lied
about. Even Chato tell lies on us, and gives us a bad
name, because he hates Geronimo. If we stay we will
be locked up. That is what is said. Now go, for I
will talk no more.”</p>

<p>Jimmie took the hint, and spurred away. He knew
better than even to look back.</p>

<small>ON THE JOB WITH CAPTAIN CRAWFORD</small></h2>
</div>


<p>One hundred and twenty Chiricahuas under
Geronimo, Chihuahua, old Nana and Nah-che were the
ones who had run away. Chato had persuaded the
three hundred other Chiricahuas to stay. He did not
approve of Geronimo and Nah-che, or of further war.</p>

<p>The outbreak had occurred on the night of May 17.
The Chiricahuas had left in parties of twenty or so, to
meet again across the border. Lieutenant Britton
Davis, of the Third Cavalry, had been in charge at the
reservation. As soon as he had discovered the loss,
he had tried to telegraph General Crook; but the “talking
wires” had been damaged. Before the message
got through, the Chiricahuas were beyond the railroad,
with a clear field ahead.</p>

<p>Nah-che had spoken truly when he said to Jimmie
that they ran away because they feared being locked up.
They knew that they were watched. And in defiance
of the general’s complaints that liquor was manufactured
upon the reservation, they had obtained a quantity
of it and drunk it—which of course made them
liable to punishment.</p>

<p>The general came over to the reservation too late;
but flying columns had been sent out at once, from
Apache and Thomas and Grant and Bowie. Two hundred
scouts from all the reservation bands were enlisted
for six months. Chato himself volunteered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span></p>

<p>The columns dispatched were mainly for the purpose
of keeping the Chiricahuas away from the border
until it might be patrolled, and the principal band
located by either the American or the Mexican troops.</p>

<p>Meanwhile as a crack pack-master Jimmie was decidedly
busy at Fort Bowie. Bowie had waxed to a
bustling supply depot, and was likely to be headquarters
field base.</p>

<p>Tom Moore, who had been up north in the Department
of the Platte, was sent for by the general to be
chief packer again in the Department of Arizona. He
brought down from Cheyenne, Wyoming, the best of
the Platte pack-mules, and was given a great welcome
at Bowie by Jimmie and the other “old-timers.”</p>

<p>The country was being scoured for good mules.
These had to be broken, some of them, and distributed.
Troops were pouring in, until the general had at his
disposal forty companies of infantry and the same of
cavalry.</p>

<p>He was planning surely. He directed that heliograph
stations, for the purpose of telegraphing by mirrored
sun-flashes, be established upon hill-tops all along
on both sides of the border. Then he went to Washington,
to get a better agreement with Mexico regarding
a joint campaign against the Apaches.</p>

<p>There was a brief period of quiet, except for hard
work that kept Jimmie, as well as others, on the move.
The final break came about the middle of October.</p>

<p>Jimmie saw the heliostat flashes which spread the
news. He was riding back to Bowie from a long trip
down to a supply camp at the border. Chancing to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
turn his head, when only a little way out from the
camp, he caught the flash of a message from a station
in the south.</p>

<p>The regulation Morse dots and dashes (long and
short flashes) were used by the stations. Now he
paused, to read. The station was at least ten miles
distant. The air was very clear, and his eyes were
good eyes.</p>

<p>What was that? No practice message, this, or ordinary
routine. The first word—even the first three
letters—stiffened him intent.</p>

<p>“H-o-s-t-i-l-e b-a-n-d h-e-a-d-g (heading) n-o-r-t-h
f-o-r D-r-a-g-o-o-n c-o-u-n-t-r-y. Q-u-i-c-k.” Signed.</p>

<p>Hah! “Wake up, Chiquito! Gwan with you!”
The message read like business, and stirring business.
Evidently the Chiricahuas were getting bold. But it
did not seem possible that with all these troops, and
the railroad, and the telegraph, and the helio stations,
and the armed and watchful settlers, a raid could
amount to much.</p>

<p>The helio stations were twenty or twenty-five miles
apart. A message had been sent from Nacori, in the
mountains of northern Mexico, two hundred miles to
Fort Bowie, in an hour. But so fast moved this band
of raiders, and so cleverly they chose their trail, that
by the time Jimmie arrived at Bowie they not only had
crossed the line but had disappeared somewhere in
Arizona!</p>

<p>Already the troops were in motion, trying to close
in and head the raiders off. It was reported that there
were eleven warriors. They were not even sighted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
again, until, suddenly, they struck the White Mountain
reservation itself—surprised a camp of the White
Mountains, killed twelve and carried away six women
and children.</p>

<p>That, then, had been the object of the raid: to take
revenge upon the reservation Apaches for sending
scouts against the Chiricahuas!</p>

<p>The White Mountains succeeded in killing one
raider, during the fight. He was Hal-zay, Nah-che’s
half-brother. They cut off his head, for a trophy. But
the ten others completed their bold circuit, and in spite
of soldiers, settlers, telegraph, heliostat and railroad
escaped back into Mexico.</p>

<p>“I never would have believed it!” declared Chief
Packer Tom Moore, to Jimmie at Bowie. “It beats
the Dutch! The general’s got every waterhole covered,
and every pass watched. Anyhow, now there’s a fresh
trail, for back-tracking on, where they came up by the
shortest way. Crawford and Cap’n Davis are going
right down after the bacon, to stay till they get Geronimo
or his scalp. I’ve picked you for assistant chief
packer with one of ’em. Which do you say? Chances
are even. You’re the boss.”</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll throw in with Crawford, Tom, if you
put it up to me,” promptly said Jimmie. Assistant
chief packer! Wow!</p>

<p>Captain Crawford and Captain Wirt Davis were
both good men, but as Tom Horn, acting chief of scouts,
had remarked: “Crawford’s my style of fighter: the
go-get-’em kind with a wolf jaw!”</p>

<p>“You’d better be makin’ up your best trains, then,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
counseled Tom, to Jimmie. “Three, I reckon. Crawford
won’t wait on sore backs or sore feet; and he’d
rather bust every man and every mule and go on by
himself, than let Davis outdo him.”</p>

<p>When Captain Crawford arrived with his column
at Bowie, from Fort Apache, on November 15, Jimmie
the assistant chief packer was ready for him. The
Captain Wirt Davis column was to be composed of
cavalry and scouts both; but Captain Crawford was
taking only scouts.</p>

<p>These were one hundred Chiricahuas, White Mountains
and Warm Springs, from the Fort Apache reservation;
but mainly Chiricahuas, with Chato as their
chief, and Ka-e-ten-na the traveler included. Micky
Free was going with the San Carlos scouts and Captain
Davis. Captain Crawford had selected so many Chiricahuas
because his goal was the Sierra Madre Range
again, and the Chiricahuas knew all that country well.</p>

<p>The scouts formed two companies, under command
of First Lieutenant Marion P. Maus, of the First Infantry,
and a gallant young “shave tail,” Second Lieutenant
William Ewen Shipp, of the Tenth Cavalry, only
two years out of West Point.</p>

<p>Another “shave tail,” Second Lieutenant Sam
Faison, of the First Infantry, who had graduated in the
same class with Lieutenant Shipp, was the adjutant,
quarter-master and commissary, all three. Dr. T. B.
Davis was the surgeon, Concepcion was the interpreter.
Al Sieber, the old war-horse, was retained to look after
the reservations, but Tom Horn was to be chief of
scouts and had proved first-class.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span></p>

<p>Altogether, it was an honor to be in pack service
with such an expedition, especially as Captain Crawford
had volunteered for the Sierra Madre trip because it
was the more dangerous of the two.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-General Phil Sheridan, commander of
the United States Army, had come out to Bowie from
Washington, to see the columns off. He and General
Crook inspected the whole outfit, in a parade at the fort.</p>

<p>“Well,” reported Chief of Scouts Horn, after a
conference in General Crook’s quarters, “this is the
idea: The general says we’re to go down into Mexico
and stay six months, if necessary, and when we strike
a trail we’re to follow it as long as it shows a single
moccasin track or pony track. Savvy? When we’ve
killed all the bucks who don’t surrender, and corralled
all the women and children, we can come up home with
our batch. Then he’ll tell ’em what’ll happen next.”</p>

<p>The march veered west through the Dragoon Mountains,
in the hope of striking the up trail and following
it down. But heavy rains had washed out the signs,
so the course was continued straight south, for the
Sierra Madre country again. The Chiricahuas were
bound to be there, if at any place.</p>

<p>Throughout the month of December the pack-train
job was the same tough job as that when General Crook
led on, in 1883: up hill, down hill, sliding, scrambling,
falling, barking shins and bruising hoofs and feet,
amidst terrific canyons, thorny brush, sharp rocks,
towering cliffs, sun and rain, heat and cold. Tom Horn
scouted far ahead with a few picked scouts; the captain
and his lieutenants and the plucky doctor, and old Concepcion,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
rode keenly with the eager main body; and
Jimmie, assistant chief packer in place of Tom Moore,
hustled his toiling pack-trains of fifty mules each, so as
to bring them into camp on time every evening.</p>

<p>Now it was the first week in January. There was
only one pack-train. Captain Crawford had ordered
that the two others be sent back to the border, two
hundred miles, with Lieutenant Faison, the commissary
and quarter-master, for supplies. So Jimmie had
detached the trains of “Chileno John” and Sam
Wisser. He had stayed.</p>

<p>Chief Scout Horn had been gone two weeks; but
he kept runners out with news from him. He had
discovered fresh sign: Indian and cattle trails; cattle
carcasses; and a recent camp. Ka-e-ten-na and Chato
had just come in. They brought word for Captain
Crawford to push on, and join the advance. Tom
would be waiting—he knew that the Chiricahuas were
yonder before him.</p>

<p>The captain sent for Jimmie.</p>

<p>“We must reduce our packs again,” he said, “for
a forced march. You will pack four of your strongest
mules with twelve days’ rations for eighty men. The
personal outfit will be cut down to one blanket for each
man. Take the shoes off the mules, to avoid noise.
The rest of the outfit will be left here, under guard
of those men who are unable to travel. Which of your
packers have you in mind, to go on?”</p>

<p>“Jimmie Dunn, captain,” smiled Jimmie.</p>

<p>“It’s afoot, you know—and probably night
marches. Will your leg stand it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span></p>

<p>“Will we strike the hostiles, captain?”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“That’s all my leg needs, to lengthen it out, then,”
laughed Jimmie.</p>

<p>He felt that he was as fit as Captain Crawford.
The captain looked badly. So did the doctor; and old
Concepcion the interpreter was about done.</p>

<p>The scouts seemed unusually solemn, as if the report
by Chato and Ka-e-ten-na had much impressed them.
They proceeded to make medicine. In the light of a
small fire old No-wa-ze-ta the medicine man unrolled
the strip of sacred buckskin that he carried; one by
one the scouts kneeled before him; he mumbled over
them and held the sacred buckskin to their lips. After
that they held a council.</p>

<p>“Some of the soldiers chiefs at Bowie say maybe
your Chiricahua will not fight,” said Jimmie, sitting
beside Chato, in a blanket, and watching. “They say
maybe you will pretend to fight, but all the time you
will be sending word to Geronimo to keep away.”</p>

<p>“That is not true,” declared Chato. “We will
fight. We are ready.”</p>

<p>About midnight camp was broken. Through the
cold and the darkness Chato and Ka-e-ten-na guided.
Each officer and man was in moccasins and packed his
own blanket. Jimmie drove the four mules.</p>

<p>About noon the signs mentioned by Tom Horn were
found: a trail, and the bodies of butchered cattle. That
evening Ka-e-ten-na pointed ahead.</p>

<p>“Espinosa del Diablo,” he said. “Maybe we cross.
Very bad country.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span></p>

<p>Espinosa del Diablo was Spanish for Devil’s Backbone—a
high mass of jagged ridges.</p>

<p>Early in the morning two more of Tom Horn’s
scouts came in. The light of Indian camp-fires had
been sighted, reflected in the sky, and Chief Scout Horn
urged the captain to hurry.</p>

<p>The command made a short march, rested until
late afternoon, and started on again, to march by night.
The country steadily grew worse, with deep, dark canyons,
steep rocky hills, heavy brush, and a river which
was constantly being forded. Moccasins were soaked
and soon cut to bits.</p>

<p>From now on, the camps were not ordered until
midnight. Only small fires of dry wood were permitted;
and under one thin blanket apiece nobody was
able to sleep, before the sun rose. In fact, it was as
miserable a time as Jimmie ever had experienced.</p>

<p>More messages arrived from Tom Horn. He had
located the Chiricahuas—had smelled the mescal steam,
had seen the fires. “Hurry!” he bade. He had only
two scouts with him.</p>

<p>Captain Crawford lengthened the marches, to all
night and half-day stretches. Some of the Apache
scouts, tough as they were, began to straggle and
limp. Doctor Davis and old Concepcion could barely
hobble.</p>

<p>At sunset of January 9, “Dutchy,” another of the
Horn scouts, appeared. Dutchy said that the Chiricahua
camp was but twelve miles away. He and Tom
and the other scout had reconnoitered it—had witnessed
the Chiricahuas moving about, herding their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
horses. They did not suspect that any enemies were
near.</p>

<p>Tom and the other scout had no blankets, and nothing
to eat but a little meat—the three of them had had
nothing else for ten days; now he, Dutchy, was to
bring the captain on at once, while the two watched the
Chiricahua camp.</p>

<p>Hurrah! The news put vim into the command.
The end of the marches was at hand. Evidently
Geronimo had no idea he could be found away in here.</p>

<p>Captain Crawford issued rapid orders.</p>

<p>“Twenty minutes’ halt. No fires. Let the men
eat bread and raw bacon. Examine arms carefully.
Pack-mules to remain here, with the packer, Doctor
Davis and the interpreter. All available men to be
ready for a night march, and attack at daylight.”</p>

<p>That was hard luck for Jimmie—but Doctor Davis
and Concepcion were completely exhausted, and somebody
had to stay with the mules, to move them on in a
jiffy when sent for.</p>

<p>In precisely twenty minutes the command set out,
guided by Dutchy. It had been the first halt in six
hours! As in the twilight they clambered up a rocky,
narrow trail, Jimmie saw that Lieutenant Maus was
helping Captain Crawford. Even at that, the captain
was obliged to pause, once or twice, and lean upon his
carbine. He used his carbine as a staff.</p>

<p>“His indomitable will is all that keeps the captain
going,” remarked Doctor Davis.</p>

<p>“Muy hombre (Much man),” groaned old Concepcion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span></p>

<p>The darkness closed in quickly. It was a bitter
cold night. Concepcion and the mules moaned, the
doctor’s teeth chattered, and wrapped in his single
blanket Jimmie shivered. The brush stirred with the
stealthy tread of prowling animals, a leopard shrieked,
at intervals, and the still air stung.</p>

<p>With the first grayness Jimmie was up, to unlimber,
and listen. The attack upon the Chiricahua camp
was due. The moments dragged. The doctor and
Concepcion seemed to have dropped asleep at last, but
they, also, shivered in their uneasy slumber. This was
the coldest period of the night—just at dawn.</p>

<small>FOES OR FRIENDS?</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Gradually the shadows upon the rocks and timber
paled; and then, suddenly—hark!</p>

<p>Rifle-shots! A spatter—a volley—more and faster,
rolling and echoing among the crags! The attack
had been made. Throwing aside their blankets, up
sprang the doctor and Concepcion, bewildered and
staggering, but awake.</p>

<p>“Fighting!” exclaimed the doctor. “They’ve
struck the hostiles! Good!”</p>

<p>“Much shooting, much shooting,” stammered old
Concepcion.</p>

<p>For fifteen minutes the rapid firing continued. It
lessened, to dropping, scattered shots, and in about an
hour ceased altogether. The sun rose.</p>

<p>“What’ll we do now?” demanded the doctor, of
Jimmie. “Crawford’s licked them, don’t you think?”</p>

<p>“Sounded like it, doctor. But we’d better be
watching sharp. Some of the bronc’s are liable to come
this way.”</p>

<p>There was another period of anxious waiting.
They took turns doing look-out duty from a high rock.
With Concepcion’s aid, Jimmie packed the mules.
About ten o’clock he could stand the suspense no longer.</p>

<p>“If we moved on we probably would meet the
word from the captain, and get there all the sooner
with the packs, doctor,” he proposed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span></p>

<p>“All right. But Concepcion and I can’t move
fast.”</p>

<p>They toiled on, following the trail. At noon they
met Dutchy.</p>

<p>“The soldier-captain says to come, with mules and
medicine-man and Concepcion.”</p>

<p>“Did you whip the Chiricahua?” queried Jimmie.</p>

<p>“Yes. We ran them like turkeys. Capture
everything—many horses. Chiricahua get away, but
they send word they will talk to-morrow.”</p>

<p>The doctor, who had been outstepped by Jimmie
and the mules, limped eagerly in, with poor old Concepcion
in his wake.</p>

<p>“What’s the news? Have they got Geronimo?”</p>

<p>“Not yet; but they captured the camp. We’re to
come on at once, doctor.”</p>

<p>“How far? Any of our men hurt?”</p>

<p>Jimmie asked Dutchy.</p>

<p>“Ten miles. Only Chiricahua hurt.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to rest,” panted the doctor. “Go ahead
with your mules. We’ll follow. Any danger?”</p>

<p>“No danger,” said Dutchy, answering Jimmie.
“Chiricahua hide till to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Dutchy plainly was in a great hurry to get back—probably
to share in the plunder. Jimmie left the
doctor and Concepcion to come as best they could, and
again hustled his mules to keep up with Dutchy. But
that proved impossible. The trail was a corker! How
in the world Captain Crawford and men ever had traveled
it in the darkness was a wonder.</p>

<p>Dutchy disappeared. Only the trail remained, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
guide. It dipped into canyons, and wound over rocks
and steep ridges. Jimmie wheezed and puffed and
sweat. He was empty from chin to knees, his legs were
leaden, he ached in every muscle. His mules repeatedly
halted, and stood heaving and straddled. But he
pushed on. The captain had sent for the packs, and
orders were orders.</p>

<p>The sun set. He had been half a day covering
these few miles! A damp fog was descending, cloaking
the mountains. If he missed the trail——! No!
Good! He saw camp-fire light, glowing on the low
clouds. At last, in the gathering dark, he labored into
the camp, to report.</p>

<p>Everybody there was asleep, utterly worn out.
Jimmie peered about, and wakened Chato and got a
small chunk of pony meat from him; unpacked his
mules and went to sleep himself, in defiance of the
cold rain that was falling. He had done his stint.
The doctor and Concepcion hardly could arrive before
morning.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that he scarcely had closed his
throbbing eyes ere he was aroused by excited cries and
loud shouts. But he had slept, for dawn was here—a
wet, foggy dawn. Amidst the fog the scouts were
yelling shrilly; upon every side men were jumping up,
grabbing guns, and staring into the mist before.</p>

<p>“Look out! Somebody comes! Many come!”
were shouting the scouts.</p>

<p>Tom Horn was up; so was Lieutenant Maus, and
Lieutenant Shipp. From where he lay exhausted, by
his fire, Captain Crawford directed the defense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span></p>

<p>“Be careful! They may be some of Captain
Davis’s men,” he warned. “Don’t fire on them till
you see who it is.”</p>

<p>“Wait for me to tell you, before you begin shooting,”
repeated Tom Horn, to the scouts.</p>

<p>He started to climb higher, for a better view.
Lieutenant Maus and Lieutenant Shipp were running
to right and left, to take command of their companies.
Down below, beyond a little basin, forms were dimly
visible. They acted like soldiers.</p>

<p>On a sudden there was a resounding crash—the red
flare of a volley lighted the fog, and a storm of bullets
pelted the camp. Jimmie, wriggling for cover, leveled
his gun, for the scouts were replying.</p>

<p>“Follow me, valientes (braves),” clearly called
a voice, in good Spanish, from the basin in front; and
a line of figures moved swiftly forward.</p>

<p>“Wait! Wait! Cease that firing! Stop your
scouts, Horn!” shouted Captain Crawford, on his feet.
“It’s a mistake. Those are Mexicans!”</p>

<p>And so they were.</p>

<p>Captain Crawford leaped upon a rock, to wave a
white handkerchief, in signal, and call.</p>

<p>“No tiras! Amigos, amigos! Americanos!
(Don’t fire! Friends, friends! Americans!),” chimed
in Lieutenant Maus, who spoke Spanish.</p>

<p>He ran down, into the open. The captain followed
him. Under the lifting mist they met four of the
Mexicans. One was a strapping big officer, evidently
the commander; another was a slender young lieutenant;
the two others were officers, also. The line of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
men behind them had halted, and stood uneasily. They
looked like a wild lot, too.</p>

<p>Chief of Scouts Horn advanced. Lieutenant Maus
talked earnestly with the big officer, and interpreted
to Captain Crawford. Tom Horn joined them, to
assist.</p>

<p>On either side of Jimmie the scouts were poking
their heads above the rocks, and cramming fresh cartridges
into their Springfields. The carbine breech-locks
snapped briskly.</p>

<p>“Mexicanos!” hissed Chato, with avid face.
“Kill them all.”</p>

<p>“You and I will kill that big man, first,” answered
Ka-e-ten-na.</p>

<p>“See!” bade Dutchy.</p>

<p>A file of other Mexican soldiers were sneaking
through a ravine, to flank the camp.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Maus had seen; he pointed, and protested
to the big officer.</p>

<p>“Watch those Mexicans, Shipp!” shouted the
captain.</p>

<p>“No tiras, no tiras!” again appealed Lieutenant
Maus, this time to the scouts.</p>

<p>“No tiras!” boomed the big officer, as if in much
alarm.</p>

<p>“Bang!” From the Mexicans at the rear sounded
a single shot. Instantly the group in the basin scattered,
each man for his own place. The Mexican line
came on at a trot, firing, loading and firing. Tom
Horn was left for a moment alone, as the captain and
the lieutenant scurried for the rocks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span></p>

<p>“The captain, is killed!” shrieked Chato, at him.
“Come back!” He and Ka-e-ten-na fired together,
and the big Mexican officer, running, threw up his
arm, and hurling his rifle far, plunged headlong.</p>

<p>“Give it to ’em,” yelled Tom, running also.</p>

<p>“Whang-g-g-g!” Everybody shot. The slender
Mexican lieutenant fell riddled. He had been hit thirteen
times! The two other Mexicans were behind a
tree; the scouts’ bullets cut the tree almost down and
the twain crumpled in a heap. The whole Mexican line
melted into sprawled figures, some lax and motionless,
some squirming for safety.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Maus arrived, panting.</p>

<p>“Head off those fellows on the right,” he rasped,
to Lieutenant Shipp. Away darted stripling Shipp, to
prevent the flank attack.</p>

<p>“Crawford’s dead—shot in the brain!” gasped
the lieutenant to Jimmie. “He’s yonder, behind a
rock. Horn’s shot in the arm. Those are Mexican irregulars.
What are they up to? But they began it.”</p>

<p>The scouts were still firing rapidly on every moving
form. The Mexicans were now hard to see.</p>

<p>“Give me orders to send out my men into the trees
and rocks and we will kill every Mexican!” shouted
Chato, to Tom Horn.</p>

<p>“Don’t waste bullets,” cautioned Tom, in Apache.
“Be careful. We are many miles from more.”</p>

<p>“We will use the Mexicans’ guns,” retorted Chato.</p>

<p>“Give me the dead captain’s gun and belt and I
will help you kill Mexicans,” spoke a new voice.
“Make me your prisoner and tell me to fight.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span></p>

<p>It was old Nana the Chiricahua chief. He had
somehow tottered in, from the rear—he was ninety
years of age and lame from a broken hip.</p>

<p>“I fight the Americans no more,” he cackled. “But
I will fight the Mexicans any time. And so will all
my people.”</p>

<p>He nodded backward; they looked, and there were
many more of the Chiricahua hostiles, at a short distance,
peering and waiting. Geronimo mounted upon
a boulder and yelled across.</p>

<p>“If you are fighting the Mexicans, tell us what
to do.”</p>

<p>That was an odd situation. If the Chiricahuas
had attacked the camp from the one side and the
Mexicans from the other——!</p>

<p>The Mexicans called, where they were concealed.</p>

<p>“Send somebody to talk with us.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Maus and Tom Horn advanced again.
Four of the Mexicans met them half-way. One of the
Mexicans was crying. His brother was the slender
young lieutenant who had been riddled.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Maus returned and talked with Lieutenant
Shipp. The Mexicans claimed that they had made
a mistake. They had lost all their officers—among
them Major Corredor, who was the big man, and, they
declared, “the bravest man that ever lived.” They
asked permission to remove their dead.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Maus accompanied each body into the
Mexican lines. The Mexicans seemed to be afraid
of the scouts.</p>

<p>Now noon was at hand, but instead of withdrawing,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
the Mexicans had taken a strong position that threatened
the camp. Many of them were Tarahumari Indians,
a Mexican tribe hostile to all Americans and
Apaches.</p>

<p>The camp was short of food and ammunition.
Several of the scouts had been wounded, one of them
severely. Tom Horn’s arm hung useless. Captain
Crawford lay underneath a blanket, with a bandanna
handkerchief spread over his face. A piece of his
forehead and a portion of his brain had been shot out,
but he still breathed.</p>

<p>Jimmie at last reported his arrival to Lieutenant
Shipp.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve seen you,” answered the lieutenant.
“You did well, but,” he frankly added, “we’re all in
a bad fix. If there’s war between the United States
and Mexico, our pack-trains are likely to be captured;
and while we’re fighting our way north, carrying Captain
Crawford, there’ll be nothing to prevent the scouts
from joining the other Chiricahuas and all together
making off to do as they please. Where’s the doctor?
Lieutenant Maus has been asking for him.”</p>

<p>Doctor Davis and Concepcion came in, agog to
know what had occurred. They had heard the firing,
again, and had hidden until it had stopped.</p>

<p>The doctor attended to the captain, and reported
that he could not live long. The other wounded were
patched up. The Mexicans needed a doctor, and he
went over to them, as was his duty.</p>

<p>He was gone some time. On his return he said that
the Mexicans had many killed and wounded, but that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
he had been badly treated, with scowls and insulting
language.</p>

<p>Some of the Geronimo Chiricahuas were in sight,
waiting. The officers did not think it advisable to hold
a council with them until the Mexicans had been disposed
of. Only old Nana was still tottering about,
cackling among the scouts. He was harmless.</p>

<p>“Give us the orders, and we will clean the earth
of those Mexicans,” implored Chato and Ka-e-ten-na,
of Tom Horn. “Then we will all have plenty of
pinole (which was meal) and bullets.”</p>

<p>Another cold, rainy night settled down early.
Lieutenant Maus directed that camp be broken at daylight,
for the march north. Captain Crawford should
be moved at once, and the pack-train that had been left
must be protected. After that, the Chiricahuas who
did not surrender would be hunted again.</p>

<p>In the morning, while a litter of reeds from the
river was being made, for carrying the captain, old
Concepcion, who had been rounding up some ponies,
called that the Mexicans had him and demanded a talk
with the commanding officer.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Maus again met a squad. They led
him aside, behind some rocks, as if to get shelter from
the rain—and presently a Mexican brought a note from
him. The note stated that he, too, was a prisoner, until
he could show papers to prove that he had permission
to “invade” Mexico. The Mexicans insisted also
upon a supply of food, and mules for their wounded.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Shipp and Chief Scout Horn conferred
together. The Mexican messenger was told to get<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
four or five men and return for the mules and rations.
Lieutenant Shipp slipped around with his company of
scouts, to a position where he might pour a deadly
fire into the Mexican lines. When the five Mexicans
returned to the camp, for the mules and rations, they
were suddenly ringed about with carbine muzzles.</p>

<p>“Now,” spoke Chief Scout Horn, “you call to
your comrades. Tell them that if our lieutenant is not
released immediately, you will all be killed!”</p>

<p>“Hi!” cackled old Nana. “That is good. Yes,
you will be killed. But we will not kill you quick.
We will shoot you in many places, first.”</p>

<p>Carbine hammers clicked. Young Lieutenant
Shipp’s scouts were crouched and aiming, ready. All
the scouts were yelling, while the five Mexicans, calling
piteously, pleaded that the lieutenant be released.</p>

<p>That, as Tom Horn said, “ended the row.” Here
came the lieutenant, angry but safe. The five prisoners
were allowed to scuttle back.</p>

<p>“They’re an ugly lot,” announced the lieutenant.
“They have over thirty dead and a dozen wounded.
Concepcion is still held. I’ve agreed to let them have
six mules in exchange, so they can pull out.”</p>

<p>The mules were Mexican mules, but the lieutenant
required a receipt for them, and the Mexican government
paid the value of them to the United States.</p>

<p>The Mexicans finally withdrew. Scouts were sent
out, on their trail, to watch them to a safe distance.
The next morning, January 13, camp was broken.</p>

<p>Captain Crawford was living, but unconscious.
Four of the scouts carried him in the litter. The trail<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
was too rough and narrow for any other method.
The Geronimo Chiricahuas had disappeared, but they
stayed near. This evening Geronimo sent an old squaw
into the new camp. He requested the talk that had
been agreed upon for the day when the Mexicans had
interrupted.</p>

<p>In the morning Lieutenant Maus took Tom Horn,
Ka-e-ten-na, Dutchy, and two or three other scouts,
and, all unarmed, met Geronimo in council.</p>

<p>“Why did you come down in here, where I thought
white men could not come?” demanded Geronimo,
direct.</p>

<p>“I came down to capture or destroy you and your
band,” answered the weary Lieutenant Maus, just as
direct.</p>

<p>“I see you speak the truth,” replied Geronimo. He
shook hands, sent a long talk, of various complaints,
to “Cluke,” and engaged to meet the general at the
border when the March moon was full.</p>

<p>“Do you think he will do it, Chato?” queried
Jimmie.</p>

<p>“Yes. Ka-e-ten-na has told him what a big people
the Americans are. Besides, Geronimo is sending in
old Nana, and some women. Chihuahua wants to
come in. Juh has been killed by the Mexicans. Pretty
soon Geronimo will have no one left.”</p>

<p>Nana arrived, again, and Geronimo’s wife, and one
of Nah-che’s wives, and another Chiricahua, and several
children. Lieutenant Maus divided his few
rations with the Geronimo band, and proceeded. Matters
looked better.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span></p>

<p>But that was a long, sorrowful march, carrying
Captain Crawford through the three hundred miles of
mountains and rain. He lived, unconscious, for five
days—he had an “indomitable will,” as had said Doctor
Davis. Without having spoken a word he died on
January 17. Of course there was no thought of leaving
him behind, in the wilds, so his body was still
carried on, in the litter.</p>

<p>He was buried at the little Mexican town of Nacori,
near the border, until he might be reburied in the
United States. The mayor of the town promised to
have the grave guarded.</p>

<p>The news of the expedition was telegraphed by
helio to Bowie. Scout runners already had been dispatched
ahead.</p>

<p>Almost the first person encountered by Jimmie,
when he rode stiffly into Bowie, on the third of February,
was Micky the Red-head, as lively as ever, after
his own long trip with the Captain Davis column.</p>

<p>“Where is Geronimo, Cheemie?” hailed Micky.</p>

<p>“He will come.”</p>

<p>“Well, if he doesn’t, we will go get him,” asserted
Micky. “We will bring him back little by little. You
look as though you had been a long way, Cheemie.”</p>

<p>“More than a thousand miles,” laughed Jimmie.
And he felt it.</p>

<p>“That’s enough for <em>you</em>,” declared Chief Packer
Tom Moore, when Jimmie reported. “You stick
around, now, and take things easy.”</p>

<p>The post was still talking of Captain Crawford’s
one march of eighteen hours with only the twenty minutes’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
halt; and of his tragic death, at the end, when
he had won his goal.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Maus, with Lieutenant Faison and Lieutenant
Shipp, Tom Horn and the scouts, was ordered
back below the border, to camp until the Chiricahuas
signalled for the talk.</p>

<p>Jimmie was laid up with his leg, for several weeks.
And at Bowie the general waited impatiently for the
news from the lieutenant’s camp.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXVII">XXVII<br />
<small>THE WORST ENEMY OF ALL</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The last week of March had opened. The moon
was near the full. Tom Moore, walking briskly, caught
Jimmie bossing the repairs on some aparejos, out at the
Bowie mule sheds.</p>

<p>“Word’s come,” rapped Tom. “I’m to take a
pack-train down to Maus to-morrow, and the general
will follow.”</p>

<p>“Is Geronimo there, Tom?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; but he’s promised to be there in
four days. Anyhow, we’re to pack a lot of rations;
and looks like we’re to feed some Injuns and fetch ’em
back. Do you want to go ’long and see the finish?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing, Tom.”</p>

<p>“Bueno! I thought you would, but I can use somebody
else if you’re not fit. All right, then. We’ll pull
out at eight o’clock.”</p>

<p>The Lieutenant Maus command had been camped
one hundred miles south of Bowie, or ten miles below
the border. But Geronimo had refused to meet the general
there, and had appointed the Cañon de los Embudos
(Funnels Canyon), twelve miles below the border
and twenty miles west, where the country was rougher.</p>

<p>Alchisé, Ka-e-ten-na, and Tony Besias and another
official interpreter went with the pack outfit. There
were two old Chiricahua squaws, also, from the bunch
who had been taken prisoners at the Geronimo rancheria<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
last January. They, and Alchisé and Ka-e-ten-na were
counted upon to spread “good talk” among the Chiricahuas.
Mayor Strauss, of Tucson, who had been at
Bowie discussing affairs with the general, joined by
special permission.</p>

<p>The general overhauled the pack-train on the second
day out. He and his staff, including Major Bourke
and Captain C. S. Roberts, of the Judge-Advocate Department,
were in an ambulance. Captain Roberts had
brought his ten-year-old son, Charley, who was seeing
army life in the Southwest; and there was an escort
of scouts, with the inevitable Micky as scout sergeant.</p>

<p>Before the Lieutenant Maus camp was reached, the
company had grown larger. Two photographers
named Fly and Chase had joined; and a Mexican, José
Maria Yaskes, who had lived with the Chiricahuas; and
several ranchers and cow-boys.</p>

<p>“All want to see Geronimo—but I guess the Gray
Fox wants to see him worst of anybody,” laughed
Micky.</p>

<p>On the morning of March 25 Alchisé and Ka-e-ten-na
sent up a smoke signal, to tell the camp and
Geronimo that the general was near. Lieutenant
Shipp, Chato and two others rode out to guide the
detachment in.</p>

<p>The Maus camp was well located, upon a mesa commanding
water and grass, in the canyon. Geronimo’s
camp was just as strongly located, a half mile away—on
the top of a lava cone surrounded by bristly gulches.</p>

<p>The packers already in camp thought that there
would be no trouble. Geronimo had been over every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
day, to ask when the general was expected for the
talk; Chihuahua had sent word that he was prepared
to surrender at any time, and do exactly as the general
told him to do.</p>

<p>“Chihuahua will leave Geronimo; Nana has left
Geronimo; soon he will have nobody,” Chato repeated.
“Geronimo and Chihuahua are living separate now.
Nana is too old to run any more.”</p>

<p>After the general had lunched, there was sudden
exclaiming and pointing. A large party of Chiricahuas
were descending from their cone.</p>

<p>“Geronimo!”</p>

<p>“Here comes the old rascal!”</p>

<p>The Chiricahuas rode on, up the canyon, and Chief
of Scouts Horn met them. He returned, and reported.</p>

<p>“Geronimo says he will talk with the general.”</p>

<p>Still, Geronimo did not enter the camp. He halted
a short distance out, amid some white-barked sycamores
and shaggy cottonwoods, near the river. The
general and officers advanced, to hold the talk, and a
crowd followed, eager to hear.</p>

<p>There were the general, Lieutenant Maus, Lieutenant
Shipp and Lieutenant Faison; Surgeon Davis (who
had recovered from his hard trip); Captain Roberts
and young Charley Roberts; Major Bourke; Chief
Packer Tom Moore, ex-Assistant Jimmie, Pack-masters
H. W. Daly and Harvey Carlisle, Packers Shaw and
Foster; Mayor Strauss, of Tucson; Photographers Fly
and Chase; Tony Besias, old Concepcion, José Maria
Yaskes, and other interpreters; Chief Scout Tom Horn,
Sergeant Micky Free, Alchisé, Ka-e-ten-na, Chato, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
others of the scout companies; and even a little boy
named Howell who had traveled along from a ranch
thirty miles away.</p>

<p>Chihuahua was here, smiling and good-natured.
So was Nah-che—not smiling, but on the contrary
looking grim and anxious. Jimmie saw Porico, or
White Horse, Geronimo’s brother. No squaws had
come over, and only a few of the warriors sat together;
the majority were scattered, well armed, wearing two
cartridge-belts, and prepared to fight and flee, if an
attempt were made to seize them.</p>

<p>Everybody except the general, Chihuahua and
Micky appeared to be rather on edge. And no wonder.
After all these months of worry and work, growing
old chasing Geronimo on the heart-breaking trails,
was this the end at last? Jimmie suddenly felt old,
himself. How far had he trailed the fighting Apaches?
Two thousand miles, at least!</p>

<p>“Ka-e-ten-na says the Chiricahua will shoot if we
try to hold Geronimo,” whispered Micky. “They
made Maus promise that the Gray Fox would bring no
soldiers down. That is bad.”</p>

<p>“But the scouts will fight.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they will fight,” nodded Micky.</p>

<p>Geronimo was speaking, as he sat twisting a strand
of buckskin in his nervous hands.</p>

<p>“Everybody on the reservation was unfriendly to
me. Chato and Micky Free stirred up trouble against
me; they lied about me to the soldier-captain Davis, and
he spread the lies. The papers told bad stories on me.
They said that I ought to be arrested and hung up.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
I don’t want any more of that talk. <a href="#i_290">Why don’t you
speak to me and look with a pleasant face?</a> What is
the matter, that you don’t smile on me? Why did you
give orders to have me put in prison? I had tried
to do right. Remember that I sent you word I would
come from a long distance to speak with you here, and
you see me now. If I thought bad or had done bad,
I would not have come.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_290">
  <img src="images/i_290.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_290">“WHY DON’T YOU SPEAK TO ME AND LOOK WITH A PLEASANT FACE?”</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>General Crook made no bones about answering.</p>

<p>“I gave no orders to have you arrested. If you
left the reservation because you were afraid, why did
you sneak all over the country killing innocent people
and stealing horses? Your story is all bosh. You sent
up your people to kill Chato and Lieutenant Davis.
Everything that you did on the reservation is known.
There is no use in your trying to talk nonsense. I am
no child. You promised me in the Sierra Madre that
the peace should last, and you have lied. How do I
know but that you are lying now, when you say you
want peace? Have I ever lied to you? You must
make up your mind either to surrender or to stay out on
the warpath. If you stay out, I will keep after you and
kill every one of you if it takes fifty years. I have
said all I have to say. You had better think, to-night,
and let me know in the morning.”</p>

<p>The perspiration had burst out upon Geronimo’s
face and hands. He would have said more, but the
general arose, as signal that the talk was at an end.
Only the two photographers were happy; they had taken
a number of excellent pictures.</p>

<p>This evening and night the two camps remained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
apart. In the Maus camp there was a great deal of discussion.
Nobody might yet foresee what the Chiricahuas
under Geronimo would do.</p>

<p>“A thousand troops couldn’t get those bronc’s,
where they’re located,” asserted Tom Moore. “They’d
scatter like quail and be off into Mexico, at first sign of
trouble. Anyhow, Maus agreed not to attack ’em, and
while the general mightn’t have made any such agreement
himself, he’s bound to stick by it.”</p>

<p>“You and I will go over in the morning, Cheemie,”
said Micky. “We will see for ourselves.”</p>

<p>So they did. Major Bourke, Mayor Strauss, of
Tucson, Pack-master Carlisle and others likewise went.
It was indeed a strong position, well up among broken
lava, with every jacal or hut defended by a cactus fence.
A number of jagged rifts had to be crossed, and there
were ravines leading away.</p>

<p>No army officer, Major Bourke alleged, could have
chosen a better situation or made more of it.</p>

<p>Geronimo and his warriors were in council, and
could not be approached. None of the Chiricahuas
would talk; even Nah-da-ste declined to speak to Jimmie,
but hid her face.</p>

<p>Young Charley Roberts was the only visitor who
could attract attention. The little girls followed him
around, giggling, and passing compliments upon him.
It reminded Jimmie of the time, long ago, when he had
been giggled at in a Chiricahua camp.</p>

<p>Nothing happened this day. Matters looked bad.
In the morning Alchisé and Ka-e-ten-na came into
camp. They had been spending their time in the Geronimo<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
camp, to spread peace talk. Ka-e-ten-na was to
tell the Chiricahuas of the sights that he had seen in
San Francisco.</p>

<p>They brought word from Chihuahua that whether
Geronimo decided to surrender, or not, he himself
would appear with all his band at noon, and do as
“Cluke” said to do.</p>

<p>At noon Chihuahua appeared. Geronimo and Nah-che
and old Nana were with him. Geronimo’s face
was blackened, as sign of mourning. The general
talked with them, again, at the same place as before.</p>

<p>“I am glad to see you, Cluke,” said Chihuahua.
“I am now in your hands. You may do as you please
with me. I am going over to stay with you in your
camp.”</p>

<p>“What have you decided?” asked the general, of
Geronimo.</p>

<p>“My people are afraid to go with you, for fear
they will be punished. They do not want to be punished.
We will go with you if we are allowed to
live as before.”</p>

<p>“That is all nonsense,” retorted the general. “I do
not trust you any more. If you go with me, you must
understand that you all will be put in the guard-house
until Washington tells me what to do with you.”</p>

<p>“How long will we be kept prisoners?”</p>

<p>“You will be sent away, like Ka-e-ten-na was.
That cured Ka-e-ten-na and made him good. It will
make you good, because it will change your hearts. You
say that lies are told about you on the reservation. If
you are sent away, there will be no lies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span></p>

<p>“How long will we be sent away?”</p>

<p>“Maybe one year, maybe two years. You may
take your families with you. Only Nana shall stay; he
is too old to make trouble.”</p>

<p>Geronimo shifted uneasily, and gazed appealingly
around.</p>

<p>“I will talk no more,” stated the general. “To-morrow
morning I shall go back to Fort Bowie. If
you decide to stay away, you will not be safe anywhere
in Mexico. You cannot hide from me. This you
already know.”</p>

<p>“We will march to Fort Bowie, and there you may
send us away, as you say,” spoke Geronimo desperately.
“But we must march freely, by ourselves. I
cannot make my men give up their guns, until they are
in the fort where you will protect them. There are
bad people along the way who would kill us. Your
young soldier-captains might not be able to control
their scouts, and the scouts would kill us. I want you
to promise that we shall not be made prisoners until
we arrive at Fort Bowie. Otherwise, I cannot persuade
my men, and there will be war.”</p>

<p>The general eyed him fixedly.</p>

<p>“It is agreed,” he said.</p>

<p>Geronimo was much relieved, and shook hands
with him.</p>

<p>“Geronimo speaks the truth,” declared Ka-e-ten-na,
that evening. “If the general had not agreed, there
would have been war. The Chiricahua were ready to
fight and run away. But they would rather be put in
prison a little while, and see such things as I have seen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span></p>

<p>Orders were given to be prepared to move in the
morning. The general was going on ahead, to Bowie,
and get instructions from General Sheridan at Washington;
Lieutenant Maus was to follow, with the
Chiricahuas.</p>

<p>That night there seemed to be a wild time in the
Geronimo camp, half a mile distant. Gun shots could
be heard, and shrill whoops. During breakfast in the
morning there were many rumors. Jimmie got the
truth from Micky.</p>

<p>“Much whiskey in the Chiricahua camp,” said
Micky, with shrug of shoulders. “Ranch man send it
in, and sell at one dollar a gallon. Geronimo drunk,
many others drunk.”</p>

<p>The general, when he rode by, looked worried.
But he had to reach the telegraph at Fort Bowie as
quickly as possible. It was understood that he had
ordered Lieutenant Maus to destroy all the whiskey that
could be found, and to hasten on with the Chiricahuas.</p>

<p>So the camp was broken, and moved on the back
trail, with directions to halt at ten miles, and wait.
The lieutenant stayed behind with Concepcion the interpreter,
to wait for the Geronimo camp to move.</p>

<p>In the afternoon he arrived at the halting place.
The Chiricahuas were following, but Geronimo had
told him not to hang around or he might be killed by
some of the drunken warriors.</p>

<p>Chihuahua sent for Chief of Scouts Horn, and
asked that he and all his band be put under guard.</p>

<p>“I don’t like that, Cheemie,” uttered Micky.
“When Chihuahua does such a thing, he sees ahead.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
He is afraid of what will happen if his people get the
whiskey, too.”</p>

<p>Geronimo made camp again about half a mile away,
as before, and in a strong position. Everybody was
ordered to keep away from it, so as to avoid trouble;
but the lieutenant took Ka-e-ten-na and rode over.</p>

<p>When they returned, Ka-e-ten-na reported that
Geronimo was still drunk, and he and another chief
were riding around on one mule; and that Nah-che
had shot his wife.</p>

<p>Now the ranch which had supplied the whiskey
was near. Lieutenant Shipp took a detail over, to
search the ranch and destroy the liquor.</p>

<p>Tom Moore, the old frontiersman, swore vigorously.</p>

<p>“It’s sure a dog-gone shame that for a few dirty
dollars any man will throw the whole country open
again to an Injun war. For that’s what it means, if
those Chiricahuas lose their heads. When whiskey
gets in, the brains go out.”</p>

<p>Concepcion said that the whiskey seller had been
filling the Chiricahuas with lies also: he had told them
that they were to be killed as soon as they reached
Bowie. He did this, so that they would stay out and
he might sell them more whiskey.</p>

<p>However, the night quieted the Chiricahuas in their
camp. The lieutenant sent over, once, to investigate.
The warriors were said to be sleeping.</p>

<p>But in the morning, which was March 29, while
Jimmie was pulling on his boots before breakfast, he
saw the lieutenant dash away, with Ka-e-ten-na, in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
direction of Geronimo’s camp. In about an hour they
returned. The lieutenant stopped here where Tom
Moore was overseeing the unpacking of the pack-trains,
for the day’s march. He looked oddly haggard, but
spoke with a hard, quick accent.</p>

<p>“Geronimo, Nah-che and twenty men and thirteen
women are gone. I’ll require a pack-train and several
of your best men, to follow them with. You can report
to Shipp. Faison will go on to Bowie.”</p>

<p>Tom’s jaw dropped, and for a moment he acted
as if too full for utterance. This, then, was the outcome
of all those other bitter pursuits—poor Captain
Crawford’s death—the general’s painstaking methods!</p>

<p>“That dog-gone liquor!” he growled.</p>

<p>Jimmie sprang forward, and saluted the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“I’d like to go with the packs, sir.”</p>

<p>“You would? Why? You’ve been once, and you
know what it means?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’d like to try again, sir. I won’t get
enough till Geronimo gets enough.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant’s face lighted up.</p>

<p>“If that’s your spirit, there’s no man I’d rather
have with me. So you and Moore settle it between
you.”</p>

<p>And he galloped on.</p>

<p>“Gosh, but this will break the general all up,”
muttered Tom. “All right,” he added. “You get
your outfit together and go along with Maus.”</p>

<p>Chihuahua, Nana, and sixty or seventy others of
the Chiricahuas still remained. Lieutenant Faison was
to take them on, up to Bowie. Lieutenant Maus and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
Lieutenant Shipp, with a company of the scouts and
Jimmie’s pack-train, set out in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>But it was no use. Geronimo had been thoroughly
frightened by the stories told him. Now his party
traveled afoot, over country where horses and mules
could not travel. In three days the trails had split and
had become impossible, and the scouts had to give up.</p>

<p>So the command turned back. When they arrived
at Bowie on April 3, this 1886, they learned that General
Crook was no longer the commander in Arizona!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXVIII">XXVIII<br />
<small>THE END OF THE TRAIL</small></h2>
</div>


<p>That was a stunning blow to the Crook men.
The general had been relieved of his command on
April 2, at his own request.</p>

<p>As far as might be learned by the rank and file,
and the pack service, the President had not approved
of the terms upon which Geronimo had surrendered;
but by this time Geronimo had fled again. Then the
dispatches from General Sheridan, commanding the
Army, to General Crook, had somewhat questioned the
wisdom of the general’s methods in depending upon
the scouts, and suggested that he now make no more
campaigns for a while, but try to protect the border
with his troops.</p>

<p>The general had replied that he still believed his
methods were the best, under the conditions; that he
had been using the troops, to protect the border; and
that it had been impossible to hold Geronimo as a
prisoner and not break the promise given him.</p>

<p>To attack Geronimo in camp had likewise been impossible
of success.</p>

<p>“It may be, however, that I am too much wedded
to my own views in this matter,” the general was said
to have added, “and as I have spent nearly eight years
of the hardest work of my life in this department, I
respectfully request that I may now be relieved from its
command.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span></p>

<p>The Apache medicine-men at Fort Bowie made
more medicine, and insisted that if Ka-e-ten-na and
other runners were sent after Geronimo, as soon as
the whiskey left him he would keep his word and
come in peaceably.</p>

<p>This was not done, because Brigadier General
Nelson A. Miles, of the Fifth Infantry, commanding
at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, had been directed to
take command of the Department of Arizona. This
of course meant new methods, and a shake-up all
’round.</p>

<p>Not knowing exactly what was ahead, Jimmie left
the pack service and became a railroad telegraph
operator.</p>

<p>At any rate, General Crook had not failed. Eighty
of the Chiricahuas, including Chihuahua and Nana,
had been brought in. Only Geronimo and Nah-che
and their twenty men and boys and thirteen women,
were out. And the Mangas squad of six men, who
had not been with Geronimo for almost a year.</p>

<p>General Miles arrived at Fort Bowie on April 12.
He immediately organized things for a campaign with
the regular troops. The War Department did not
favor trusting in the scouts as fighters—especially in
the scouts from the White Mountain and Chiricahua
friendlies.</p>

<p>The General Crook scouts had been discharged,
and so were many of the interpreters. Tom Horn left.
Yes, there was a decided shake-up.</p>

<p>But the new general seemed to be a good man, all
right, and the Arizona newspapers put much faith in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
him. He extended the heliograph service, until a
perfect network of stations had been established; and
he injected fresh vim into the officers.</p>

<p>Suspecting that they were to get no terms at all,
now, and to show that they despised the soldiers, Geronimo
and Nah-che went thoroughly bad. Perhaps
General Crook’s methods might have been better; perhaps
not; but toward the last of April Geronimo and
Nah-che led their few warriors straight up past Tucson
itself; the troops had not been able to protect the
border, and Nah-che penetrated clear to Fort Apache.</p>

<p>They lost only one man. He was a deserter, and
volunteered to follow them, as “Peaches” had. The
troops did heroic work. Lieutenant Lloyd Brett, of the
Second Cavalry, marched twenty-six hours without a
halt; his troopers were forced to drink their own
blood, to quench thirst.</p>

<p>Captain Henry W. Lawton, of the Fourth Cavalry,
and Captain Leonard Wood, assistant surgeon in the
army, were selected to push the pursuit through Mexico,
with a picked command of the Eighth Infantry and
Fourth and Tenth Cavalry. Surgeon Wood was instructed
to see if the men could not outdo even the
Apaches.</p>

<p>Tom Horn went in charge of some Tonto and
Yuma trailers. The Lawton and Wood column made
terrific marches; altogether, fourteen hundred miles.
On July 13, three hundred miles into Mexico they surprised
the Geronimo and Nah-che camp, as Captain
Crawford had surprised it, the January before.</p>

<p>Nah-che had been wounded; he and Geronimo and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
their band barely escaped. They sent word to a Mexican
woman (the wife of the interpreter José Maria
Yaskes) that they desired to surrender.</p>

<p>It was a Crook man, after all—Lieutenant George
Gatewood—who performed the bravest act; and a
General Crook method that clinched the surrender.
From Fort Apache the lieutenant, under orders by
General Miles, traveled down with only Kah-yee-ta, the
deserter, and Martinez, another Chiricahua, to find the
hostile camp and talk with Geronimo. This was done.
Lieutenant Gatewood’s life hung by a hair; but his
talk had effect, for in the morning Geronimo, Nah-che,
and their warriors surrendered to Captain Lawton.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Gatewood had been instructed to offer
them no terms whatsoever, except that their lives would
be spared; the captain offered the same terms.</p>

<p>Geronimo agreed to march along with the column,
just as before. He and his men were still very suspicious,
but he sent Porico up to General Miles as a
pledge of good faith.</p>

<p>The general met him at the border, on September 3.
Geronimo did not know that while he had been out, all
the Chiricahuas upon the reservation—Chato, Ka-e-ten-na,
and all—had been moved, and were started for
Florida.</p>

<p>“This,” as Tom Moore explained to Jimmie, “took
the sap out of him. He had no base of trouble, any
more. Nah-che hadn’t come in with him, but he sent
out after him, and the whole band—what there was left
of them—were packed aboard the cars on September 8,
and now they’re on their way, too. Let’s see—this is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
1886. How long have you known Geronimo,
anyhow?”</p>

<p>“Sixteen years,” said Jimmie.</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll never see him again.”</p>

<p>And Jimmie never did.</p>

<p>He never saw General Crook again, either. The
general had resumed command of the Department of
the Platte; and as major-general was assigned to the
command of the Division of the Missouri, with headquarters
in Chicago.</p>

<p>But he was not forgotten in Arizona. The Indians
at the San Carlos and the Fort Apache reservations
continued to hold him in their hearts. Jimmie happened
to be at Fort Apache, on business, when in the
spring of 1890 the news of the general’s death was
received.</p>

<p>The old men and women, and all the White Mountain
scouts, “sat down in a great circle, let down their
hair, bent their heads forward upon their bosoms, and
wept and wailed like children.” And in the far north
the Sioux also lamented the passing of their conqueror
but friend, the Gray Fox.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
